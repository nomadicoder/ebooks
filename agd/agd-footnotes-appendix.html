It is conventionally argued, e.g., by Professor Due, that we should not
include government <i>transfer payments, </i>e.g., relief
payments, in any such expenditures deducted because transfer payments
are not included in the original GNP
figure. But the important consideration is that <i>taxes </i>(or
deficits) to finance transfer payments <i>do act</i> as a
drain on the national product, and therefore must be subtracted from
GPP to yield PPR. Due claims that, in gauging the relative size of
governmental and private activity, transfer payments should not be
included
because they &ldquo;merely shift purchasing power&rdquo; from
one set of private hands to
another, without the government&rsquo;s using up resources. But
this &ldquo;mere shift&rdquo; is just
as much a burden upon the private producers, just as much a shift from
voluntary
production to state-created privilege, as any other governmental
expenditure. It
is a government-induced using of resources. John F. Due, <i>Government
Finance</i>
(Homewood, Ill.: Richard D. Irwin, 1954), pp. 64, 76&ndash;77. </p></a></font>

A surplus slightly overestimates the extent of depredation if it is
used to
deflate the money supply, and government expenditures slightly
overstate the
extent of depredation by counting in the amount of government taxes
levied on
government bureaucrats themselves. The amount of distortion is slight,
however,
particularly for the 1929&ndash;1932 period, and is less than the
distortion of using
GNP instead of GPP, and thus counting governmental payment of salaries
as
equivalent to the &ldquo;product&rdquo; of government. </p></a></font>

Of course, official figures are not always accurate estimates of true
depreciation. For a cogent discussion of the advantages and
disadvantages of using <i>net</i> or
<i>gross</i> measures of the governmental burden on the
economy, see <i>The Tax Burden
In Relation To National Income and Product</i> (New York: Tax
Foundation, 1957). </p></a></font>

Because, in our figures, state and local governments are already lumped
together, our estimates will, from this standpoint, considerably <i>underestimate
the
fiscal burden of government on the private sector.</i></p></a></font>
