	control, but
	the government should cooperate by research, intellectual leadership
	[sic]<i>, </i>and
	prohibitions upon the abuse of power.&rdquo; </a></p>

	<p><a name="Note-7-15"><sup>15</sup>In reality, public works only prolong the
	depression, aggravate the malinvestment problem, and intensify the
	shortage of savings by wasting more capital.
	They also prolong unemployment by bolstering wage rates. See Mises, <i>Human
	Action </i>(New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1949), pp.
	792&ndash;94. </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-7-16"><sup>16</sup>The payment of charity wages as high as market
	rates began in the depression of 1893; public works as a depression
	remedy started on a municipal scale in
	the recession of 1914&ndash;1915. The secretary of Mayor John
	Purroy Mitchell&rsquo;s New
	York Committee on Unemployment urged public works in 1916, and Nathan
	J.
	Stone, chief statistician of the U.S. Tariff Board, urged a national
	public works
	and employment reserve in 1915. Immediately after the war, Governor
	Alfred E.
	Smith of New York and Governor Frank O. Lowden of Illinois urged a
	national
	public works stabilization program. See Raphael Margolin,
	&ldquo;Public Works as a
	Remedy for Unemployment in the United States&rdquo; (unpublished

	The American Construction Council was formed in response to the
	hounding of the New York construction industry by state and Federal
	authorities during the depression of 1920&ndash;1921. The
	governments charged the industry with
	&ldquo;price-fixing&rdquo; and &ldquo;excessive
	profits.&rdquo; Hoover and Roosevelt together formed the
	Council in the summer of 1922, to stabilize and organize the industry.
	The aim
	was to cartelize construction, impose various codes of operation and
	&ldquo;ethics,&rdquo; and
	to plan the entire industry. Franklin Roosevelt, as President of the
	Council, took
	repeated opportunity to denounce profit-seeking and rugged
	individualism. The
	&ldquo;codes of fair practice&rdquo; were Hoover&rsquo;s
	idea. See Daniel R. Fusfeld, <i>The Economic
	Thought of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Origins of the New Deal </i>(New
