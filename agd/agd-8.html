<h3>The Depression Begins: President Hoover Takes Command</h3>


</div>


</b>

<p><font size="+2"><b>A</b></font><a name="link8">nd so we see that when the Great
Depression struck, heralded by the stock market crash of October 24,
President
Hoover stood prepared for the ordeal, ready to launch anunprecedented program of
government intervention for high wage
rates, public works, and bolstering of unsound positions that was
later to be christened the New Deal. As Hoover recalls: </p>



<blockquote>the primary question at once
arose as to whether the
President and the Federal government should undertake
to investigate and remedy the evils. . . . No President
before had ever believed that there was a governmental
responsibility in such cases. No matter what the urging
on previous occasions, Presidents steadfastly had maintained that the
Federal government was apart from such
eruptions . . . therefore, we had to pioneer a new field.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>



As his admiring biographers,
Myers and Newton, declared, &ldquo;President Hoover was the first
President in our history to offer Federal
leadership in mobilizing the economic resources of the
people.&rdquo; He
was, of course, not the last. As Hoover later proudly proclaimed: It
was a &ldquo;program unparalleled in the history of depressions in
any
country and any time.&rdquo; </p>

<p>There was opposition within the
administration, headed, surprisingly enough, considering his
interventions throughout the boom,
by Secretary of Treasury Mellon. Mellon headed what Hoover
scornfully termed &ldquo;the leave-it-alone
liquidationists.&rdquo; Mellon
wanted to &ldquo;liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the
farmers,
liquidate real estate,&rdquo; and so &ldquo;purge the
rottenness&rdquo; from the economy, lower the high cost of living,
and spur hard work and efficient
enterprise. Mellon cited the efficient working of this process in the
depression of the 1870s. While phrased somewhat luridly, this was
the sound and proper course for the administration to follow. But
Mellon&rsquo;s advice was overruled by Hoover, who was supported by
Undersecretary of the Treasury Ogden Mills, Secretary of Commerce
Robert Lamont, Secretary of Agriculture Hyde, and others.</p>



<center><h3>THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCES</h3></center>

<p>Hoover acted quickly and decisively. His most important act
was to call a series of White House conferences with the leading
financiers and industrialists of the country, to induce them to
maintain wage rates and expand their investments. Such artificially
induced expansion could only bring losses to business and thereby
aggravate the depression. Hoover phrased the general aim of these
conferences as &ldquo;the coordination of business and governmental
agencies in concerted action.&rdquo; The first conference was on
November 18, with the presidents of the nation&rsquo;s major
railroads.
Attending for the government were Hoover, Mellon, and Lamont,
and also participating was William Butterworth, President of the
United States Chamber of Commerce. The railroad presidents
promised Hoover that they would expand their construction and
maintenance programs, and publicly announced this promise on
November 19. Later, the railroad executives met in Chicago to
establish a formal organization to carry this program into effect. </p>



<p>The most important White House
conference was held on
November 21. All the great industrial leaders of the country were
there, including such men as Henry Ford, Julius Rosenwald,
Walter Teagle of Standard Oil, Matthew Sloan, Owen D. Young,
Edward Grace, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., Pierre DuPont, and William
Butterworth. The businessmen asked Hoover to stimulate the
cooperation of government and industry. Hoover pointed out to
them that unemployment had already reached two to three million, that a
long depression might ensue, and that wages must be
kept up! Hoover 



<blockquote>explained that immediate
&ldquo;liquidation&rdquo; of labor had
been the industrial policy of previous depressions; that
his every instinct was opposed to both the term and the
policy, for labor was not a commodity: it represented
human homes. . . . Moreover, from an economic viewpoint such action
would deepen the depression by suddenly reducing purchasing power. </blockquote>



Hoover insisted that if wage
rates were to be reduced eventually,
they must be reduced &ldquo;no more and no faster than the cost of
living had previously fallen, (so that) the burden would not fall
primarily on labor.&rdquo; In short, real wage rates must be
prevented from
failing. Hoover was insistent that the first shock of the depression
must fall on profits and not on wages&mdash;precisely the reverse
of
sound policy, since profits provide the motive power for business
activity. At present, then, wage rates should not be reduced at all,
and industry should maintain its construction work. Industry
should try to keep everyone employed, and any necessary reductions in
work should be spread over all employees by reducing the
work-week. (Reducing the work-week can only spread unemployment, and
prevent that pressure of the unemployed upon wage
rates which alone could have restored genuine full employment
and equilibrium to the labor market.) If industry followed this
course, &ldquo;great hardship and economic and social difficulties
would
be avoided.&rdquo; The industrialists all agreed to carry out the
Hoover
program, and further organized cooperative efforts on its behalf in
a conference in Washington on December 5. </p>



<p>The agreement was also announced
publicly, and, in addition,
the telephone industry, steel industry, and automobile industry
pledged to expand their construction programs. The industrialists
at the conference pledged not to cut wages, and recommended that
all employers in the nation do the same. Henry Ford, in fact,
bravely announced a wage <i>increase</i>. Nor was
industrial cooperation
left on a haphazard basis. Representatives of business were
appointed to a temporary advisory committee, along with Secretary
of Commerce Lamont. The group, along with representatives of
various trade associations, then merged into an Executive Committee
headed by Mr. Julius Barnes, chairman of the United States
Chamber of Commerce, to coordinate industry collaboration on
the Hoover program. </p>



<p>On November 22, Hoover called a
conference at the White
House of leading representatives of the building and construction
industries, and they also pledged to maintain wage rates and
expand their activity. On November 27, the President called a similar
conference of the leading public utility executives, and they
unanimously pledged to maintain wage rates and expand construction. The
latter included representatives of the American Gas
Association, the National Electric Light Association, and the Electric
Railways and American Railways Associations. </p>



<p>In a burst of
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, Hoover recalls that the nation&rsquo;s
leading
labor leaders, called to a White House conference on November 21,
also agreed to cooperate in the program and not press for further
wage increases, this gesture being presumably a sign of their basic
&ldquo;patriotism.&rdquo; These leaders included William Green,
Matthew
Woll, John L. Lewis, William Hutcheson, A.F. Whitney, and
Alvanley Johnston. The agreement put very little strain upon their
patriotism, however, since the Hoover program was tailor-made to
fit the very doctrine that union leaders had been long proclaiming.
There was no chance of wage <i>increases</i> in an
unhampered market.
The point is that unions did not have the power to enforce wage
<i>floors</i> throughout industry (unions in this era being
weak, constituting only about 7 percent of the labor force, and
concentrated in
a few industries), and so the federal government was proposing to
do it for them. </p>



<p>But even in an agreement so
favorable to unions, the labor leaders were ready to scrap their part
of the bargain at the first opportunity. William Green wrote the
affiliated unions on November 27,
emphasizing that the agreement concluded with Hoover was not
binding, and assuring his colleagues that they were free to press for
higher wage rates in their negotiations.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>In his annual message to Congress
on December 3, Hoover
pointed out that depressions had always been marked by retrenchment of
construction activity and reduction of wage rates, but now
things were different:



<blockquote>I have instituted . . .
systematic . . . cooperation with
business . . . that wages and therefore earning power
shall not be reduced and that a special effort shall be
made to expand construction . . . a very large degree of
individual suffering and unemployment has been prevented. </blockquote></p>



<p>On December 5, Hoover called
together a larger conference of
industrial leaders in Washington, to adopt the Hoover program.
Hoover addressed the conference to hail their agreement, as an



<blockquote>advance in the whole conception
of the relationship of
businesses to public welfare. You represent the business
of the United States, undertaking through your own
voluntary action to contribute something very definite
to the advancement of stability and progress in our economic life. This
is a far cry from the arbitrary and dogeat-dog attitude of the business
world of some thirty or
forty years ago. </blockquote></p>



<p>With all the leading
industrialists thus pledged to maintain wage
rates, expand construction, and share any reduced work, it was no
wonder that the American Federation of Labor hailed the new
development. Its journal, the <i>American Federationist</i>,
editorialized
on January 1, 1930: 



<blockquote>The President&rsquo;s
conference has given industrial leaders
a new sense of their responsibilities. . . . Never before
have they been called upon to act together . . . in earlier
recessions they have acted individually to protect their
own interests and . . . have intensified depressions.<sup>3</sup></blockquote>



By the following March, the A.F.
of L. was hailing the new attitude
toward wages, with employers now realizing&mdash;in contrast to the
1921 depression&mdash;that it is poor business to destroy consumer
purchasing power, and it greeted the fact that not one of the big
corporations had thought of lowering wages as a means of reducing
unit costs. The A.F. of L. proclaimed that business was now adopting
the purchasing-power gospel of W.T. Foster, and stated that the
United States will &ldquo;go down in history as the creator of [an]
. . .
epoch in the march of civilization&mdash;high wages.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>



<center><h3>INFLATING CREDIT</h3></center>
<p>If the Federal Reserve had an
inflationist attitude during the
boom, it was just as ready to try to cure the depression by inflating
further. It stepped in immediately to expand credit and bolster
shaky financial positions. In an act unprecedented in its history, the
Federal Reserve moved in during the week of the crash&mdash;the
final
week of October&mdash;and in that brief period added almost $300
million to the reserves of the nation&rsquo;s banks. During that
week, the
Federal Reserve doubled its holdings of government securities,
adding over $150 million to reserves, and it discounted about $200
million more for member banks. Instead of going through a
healthy and rapid liquidation of unsound positions, the economy
was fated to be continually bolstered by governmental measures
that could only prolong its diseased state. This enormous expansion was
generated to prevent liquidation on the stock market and
to permit the New York City banks to take over the brokers&rsquo;
loans
that the &ldquo;other,&rdquo; non-bank, lenders were
liquidating. The great
bulk of the increased reserves&mdash;all
&ldquo;controlled&rdquo;&mdash;were pumped
into New York. As a result, the weekly reporting member banks
expanded their deposits during the fateful last week of October by
$1.8 billion (a monetary expansion of nearly 10 percent <i>in
one
week</i>), of which $1.6 billion were increased deposits in New
York
City banks, and only $0.2 billion were in banks outside of New
York. The Federal Reserve also promptly and sharply lowered its
rediscount rate, from 6 percent at the beginning of the crash to 42
percent by mid-November. Acceptance rates were also reduced
considerably. </p>



<p>By mid-November, the great stock
break was over, and the market, falsely stimulated by artificial
credit, began to move upward
again. <i>Standard and Poor&rsquo;s</i> stock price
monthly averages, which had
climbed from 56 in mid-1921 to 238 in September 1929&mdash;more
than quadrupling&mdash;fell to 160 in November, a one-third drop in
the course of two months. By the end of the year, stock prices had
risen by several points. The stock market emergency over, bank
reserves declined to their pre-crash levels. In two
weeks&mdash;from
November 13, when stock prices hit bottom, to November 27&mdash;
member bank reserves declined by about $275 millions, or to
almost exactly the level existing just before the crash. The decline
did not come in securities, which <i>increased</i> in the
Federal Reserve
portfolio from $293 million on October 30 to $326 million a
month later&mdash;a rise of $33 million. Discounts fell by about
$80
million, and acceptances by another $80 million, while money in
circulation embarked on its seasonal increase, rising by $70 million.
Thus, from the end of October to the end of November, <i>controlled
reserves</i> were reduced by $111 million (including
miscellaneous factors not itemized here); uncontrolled reserves, which
were more important, fell by $165 million. </p>



<p>By the end of 1929, total
reserves at $2.36 billion were only a little over $20 million below the
level of October 23 or November 27
($2.38 billion on each date), but the distribution of factors was
considerably different. Thus, while total reserves were almost the
same on October 23 and December 31, security holdings had
increased by $375 million, more than tripling Reserve holdings of
U.S. governments. Total discounts were about $165 million less,
acceptances slightly larger, money in circulation higher by over
$100 million, and the gold stock down by $100 million. Of the $23
million fall in reserves from October 23 to December 31, <i>controlled</i>
reserves increased by $359 million (with government securities the
overriding factor), while <i>uncontrolled</i> reserves
fell by $381 million.
It is evident, therefore, that the failure to inflate reserves over the
last quarter of 1929 was no credit of the Federal Reserve, which
did its best to increase reserves, but was foiled by the decline in
uncontrolled factors. The total money supply, as gauged by member bank
demand deposits adjusted and time deposits, increased
slightly&mdash;by about $300 million&mdash;during the final
quarter of 1929. </p>



<p>President Hoover was proud of his
experiment in cheap money,
and in his speech to the business conference on December 5, he
hailed the nation&rsquo;s good fortune in possessing the splendid
Federal
Reserve System, which had succeeded in saving shaky banks, had
restored confidence, and had made capital more abundant by
reducing interest rates. Hoover had done his part to spur the
expansion by personally urging the banks to rediscount more
extensively at the Federal Reserve Banks. Secretary Mellon issued
one of his by now traditionally optimistic pronouncements that
there was &ldquo;plenty of credit available.&rdquo; And William
Green issued a
series of optimistic statements, commending the Federal
Reserve&rsquo;s
success in ending the depression. On November 22, Green said: 



<blockquote>All the factors which make for a
quick and speedy industrial and economic recovery are present and
evident.
The Federal Reserve System is operating, serving as a
barrier against financial demoralization. Within a few
months industrial conditions will become normal, confidence and
stabilization in industry and finance will be
restored. </blockquote></p>



<center><h3>PUBLIC WORKS</h3></center>



<p>With Hoover&rsquo;s views, we would not expect him to delay in
sponsoring public works and unemployment relief as aids in curing</p>



<p>depressions. On November 23,
Hoover sent a telegram to all the
governors, urging cooperative expansion of all state public works
programs. The governors, including Franklin D. Roosevelt of New
York, heartily pledged their cooperation, and on November 24 the
Department of Commerce established a definite organization to
join with the states in public works programs. Hoover and Mellon
also proposed to Congress an increase in the Federal Buildings
program of over $400 million, and on December 3 the Department
of Commerce established a Division of Public Construction to spur
public works planning. Hoover himself granted more subsidies to
ship construction through the federal Shipping Board and asked for
a further $175 million appropriation for public works. By the end
of the year, Professor J.M. Clark of Columbia University was
already hailing President Hoover&rsquo;s &ldquo;great
experiment in constructive industrial statesmanship of a promising and
novel sort.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>



<center><h3>THE NEW DEAL FARM PROGRAM</h3></center>



<p>The New Deal program of farm subsidies, characterized especially by
farm price supports, arrived in the United States under
the Hoover, not the Roosevelt, administration. To understand this
development, we must sketch the emergence of the farm bloc and
its drive for Federal intervention in the 1920s. The first cloud no
bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand of government grants of special
privilege
to farmers, came with the agricultural extension program by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, which had its beginnings at the
turn of the twentieth century, and was fully established in 1914. In
1916, the United States Warehouse Act imposed regulations on
agricultural warehouses. </p>



<p>The important drive for farm
privilege came at the end of the
war, when farm groups began to organize throughout the nation,
originally at the behest of the county agents of the USDA, who
were operating under the extension program. Soon the farm
groups, led especially by the midwestern farmers, formed a pressure
bloc in Congress. The bloc was cemented in the spring of 1921
under the pressure of the American Farm Bureau Federation and
led in the Senate by senators from the midwest. The farm bloc first
showed its power and its statist drift, in the summer of 1921, when
it drove through Congress several interventionist
measures&mdash;the
regulation of meat packers; regulation of trading in grain futures;
renovating and enlarging the War Finance Corporation, and
establishing it as an aid to farmers; and an increase in the capital of
the previously dormant Federal Farm Loan System.<sup>6</sup></p>



<p>The first massive intervention in
agriculture had been the Federal Farm Loan System, established by the
Federal Farm Loan Act
of July, 1916. This System had set up a network of Federal Land
Banks, under a Federal Farm Loan Board, to lend money on longterm
mortgages (under subsidized terms) to cooperative farm loan
associations. The regulation of the meat packers and stockyards
was the culmination of a demagogic campaign against the packers
and yards that had been conducted for years. Since meat packers
had few votes, it was common sport for farmers to agitate that the
packers were paying them too little for livestock, while consumers
denounced packers for charging them too high a price for meat.
This harassment of efficient large-scale enterprise bore fruit in a
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation and in bills before
Congress during the war. Under the guise of a war emergency,
Congress threatened to authorize the President to seize and operate the
large stockyards himself. After threatening an antitrust suit,
Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, in February, 1920, managed
to force the packers to agree to a Packers&rsquo; Consent Decree,
which
forced the packers out of all non-meat production, including
stockyards, warehouses, wholesale and retail meat, etc.<sup>7</sup>
Yet, agitation
continued and culminated in the Packers and Stockyards Act of
1921, which established a detailed regulation of the activities of
packers, including their pricing policy, under the direction of the
Secretary of Agriculture. </p>



<p>The Futures&rsquo; Trading
Act also followed years of demagogic
attacks upon grain speculators and middlemen, whose votes were also
few. In this case, even an FTC investigation found no need for
stringent regulation. Yet, the Futures&rsquo; Trading Act placed a
prohibitory
tax of 20 cents a bushel on speculative transactions, including
futures, puts and calls, bids and offers, except when made in certain
specific markets authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture. </p>



<p>The War Finance Corporation
(WFC), headed by Eugene
Meyer, Jr., had made loans to exporters during 1919 and 1920.
Suspended in May, 1920, the WFC was reactivated by Congress
over the veto of President Wilson in January, 1921. It did not then
do very much to finance exports, however; its major role at that
point was bailing out country banks that had loaned to
farmers&mdash;
an operation that served as a model for the later Reconstruction
Finance Corporation. The WFC worked closely with farm bloc
leaders and appointed a Corn Belt Advisory Committee of these
leaders to pressure midwest bankers into lending more heavily to
farmers. The Act of August 1921, drafted by Chairman Meyer and
Secretary of Commerce Hoover, increased the maximum authorized credits
of the WFC to $1 billion and permitted it to lend
directly to farmers&rsquo; coops and foreign importers, as well as
to
American exporters.<sup>8 </sup>The WFC could then supply
agricultural
capital. The aims of the expanded WFC were to encourage farm
exports, raise farm prices, subsidize cheap credit to farmers, and
subsidize farm cooperatives&mdash;which were to become the pampered
pets of the government throughout this period. The new WFC
superseded the Stock Growers&rsquo; Finance Corporation, an
organization promoted by the Federal Reserve in the spring of 1921 and
financed by Eastern banks to stabilize the livestock market. The
expanded WFC made loans of $39 million for exports and $297
million for agriculture, virtually ending its operations in 1925,
after the creation of the Federal Intermediate Credit System.<sup>9</sup>
The
bulk of its loans had gone to farm cooperatives. </p>



<p>In the fall of 1921, the
Interstate Commerce Commission,
under Farm Bureau pressure, used its dictatorial powers over the
railroad industry to order a sharp overall 10 percent cut in freight
rates&mdash;largely to aid Western grain. The Senate also directed
the
FTC to investigate the supposedly too low export prices that were
being paid to grain farmers. </p>



<p>In the meanwhile, Congress
established a Joint Commission on
Agricultural Inquiry, which delivered a report in October, 1921. It
recommended that the government authorize more farm cooperatives, that
it provide for intermediate-term credit to farmers, that
agricultural freight rates be lowered (this was quickly adopted),
that there be special agricultural attach&eacute;s in foreign
countries, that
agricultural departments expand their research, and that more
wholesale terminals be provided. An even more ominous note
occurred&mdash;again belying the myth of laissez-faire in the
1920s&mdash;
when President Harding allowed Secretary of Agriculture Henry C.
Wallace to pressure him into calling a National Agricultural
Conference, at the end of January, 1922. In his opening address,
Harding called for increased Federal aid to cooperatives, and took the
radical step of endorsing crop restrictions by co-ops to obtain
higher farm prices. The conference&mdash;consisting of farm
leaders,
farm machinery manufacturers, meat packers, and economists such
as Richard T. Ely and under the aegis of the
administration&mdash;recommended stabilization of the price level,
continuation of the
WFC, an agricultural representative on the Federal Reserve
Board, crop insurance, more federal regulation of warehouses,
agricultural tariffs, development of plants to produce cheap fertilizer
at the Muscle Shoals Dam, a St. Lawrence Seaway, federal aid
to farm cooperatives, and steps toward aiding farm prices in some
undefined manner&mdash;although outright price fixing was rejected.
</p>



<p>In 1922, Congress passed the
Capper&ndash;Volstead Cooperative
Marketing Act, which exempted cooperative marketing associations from
the antitrust laws, with the crucial requirement that no
farmer have more than one vote in the co-op. The Futures Trading Act
was declared unconstitutional by the courts, but the
intrepid Congress passed a new law&mdash;the Grain Futures Act of
1922&mdash;with similar provisions. </p>



<p>In March 1922, the government
made available over $1 million
for the purchase of seed grain in crop failure areas. But the farm
bloc wanted credits on a more regular basis. Farmers could obtain
abundant bank credit for short-term loans (under six months), and
they could obtain long-term mortgages from the Federal Land
Banks and other institutions; they now felt a gap in the intermediate
credit range. A tug-of-war ensued in Congress between two
farm-bloc bills: the Capper&ndash;McFadden Bill, supported by
Eugene
Meyer, Jr., livestock interests, and cooperative marketers, which
would have extended Federal Reserve powers to farm credits, and
the Lenroot&ndash;Anderson Bill, presented by the Joint Commission
of
Agricultural Inquiry (appointed by Harding in 1921) and backed
by the three large national farmers&rsquo; organizations. The
latter bill
would have created new institutions with capital subscribed by the
Treasury, to grant intermediate (six months to three years) credits.
This bill was supported by Secretaries Wallace and Hoover (and
also backed by the National Agricultural Conference). The final
result combined features of both bills, with perhaps more emphasis on
the Lenroot&ndash;Anderson Bill. The Agricultural Credits Act of
1923 established a vast system of Federal farm credit; there were
12 Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, patterned after the Federal
Reserve Banks, and run by the Federal Farm Loan Board. Funds
were supplied directly by the Treasury, and the banks were to make
loans to farm associations for any agricultural purpose. </p>



<p>Apparently the dictation over
packers and stockyards did not
prove sufficient, and in 1924 the Secretary of Agriculture ordered
smaller commission firms and traders to stop &ldquo;discriminating
against&rdquo; farm cooperatives in their purchases. The Packers
and
Stockyards Administration of the USDA also directly helped farm
cooperatives to find markets, and investigated the books of many
private commission firms. </p>



<p>This pattern of farm intervention
was the overture to the crucially important and characteristically New
Deal policy of farm
price support. At first, the farmers tried voluntary methods. During
1920, farm organizations centered in Kansas and Nebraska, for
example, tried to hold wheat off the market and to reduce acreage
in an attempt to raise the price. But such a local attempt could only
fail, despite feeble efforts to organize farmers into a National
Wheat Growers&rsquo; Association. The withholding of wheat from the
market resulted in drastic losses as wheat prices continued downward.
An impudent attempt to induce the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to
grant special credits to farmers to permit them to
withhold wheat collapsed. </p>



<p>Similar failure attended the
cartellizing efforts of the American
Cotton Association in the South. In fact, at the end of 1920, cotton
planters reacted to failing prices by resorting to violence,
including murder and destruction of the cotton and cotton gins of
recalcitrants in order to reduce the quantity of cotton produced
and sold. Under planter pressure, Governor Parker of Louisiana
asked cotton gins to cease operations until cotton had achieved a
&ldquo;living price,&rdquo; and similar advice was given
farmers by the Texas
Department of Agriculture. But while sales in these states
declined, prices also continued to fall. Several times, the farm
organizations tried to induce the Federal Reserve Board to supply
funds for withholding cotton and other farm products, but Governor
W.P.G. Harding and Secretary of the Treasury Houston
stoutly refused to intervene.<sup>10</sup></p>



<p>The next year, 1921, saw
determined and well organized efforts
toward a nationwide cotton cartel. The American Cotton Association,
<i>The Cotton News</i>, and other groups urged an acreage
reduction of
up to 50 percent for cotton, and South Carolina officially proclaimed a
&ldquo;Cotton Acreage Reduction Day.&rdquo;<sup>11</sup>
Acreage was
reduced considerably, and this, joined with a poor crop, lowered
the supply greatly; but cotton prices rose less than proportionately
to the fall in output, thus frustrating the cartellists once again. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, in corn, Henry A.
Wallace, editor of
<i> Wallace&rsquo;s
Farmer</i>, preached the gospel of &ldquo;sagacious
sabotage,&rdquo; a presumably
voluntary way to restrict corn production. The campaign got
nowhere among the farmers in 1921, but Wallace tried again in
1922 and urged the state Farm Bureau Federations, with indifferent
success, to fix systematic township and county acreage quotas
for corn. Several farm journals and organizations endorsed the
idea, but the major farm leaders were repelled by the idea of formal
farm quotas.<sup>12</sup> The result was failure once more,
the Corn Belt
even increasing its acreage of corn. </p>



<p>The chief stumbling block in all
these schemes was the noncooperating farmer, the rugged individualist
who profited by expanding his production while his rival farmers cut
theirs. Unlike his
counterparts in industrial labor, he was not deterred by such
favored epithets of frustrated cartellists as
&ldquo;scab&rdquo; and &ldquo;traitor to his
fellow-farmers,&rdquo; hurled at him by such organs as <i>Wallace&rsquo;s
Farmer</i>. </p>



<p>The next step in the drive for a
farm cartel was the &ldquo;Sapiro
Movement,&rdquo; inspired by Aaron Sapiro, a high-priced young
attorney for several California cooperatives. The plan was launched,
under Sapiro&rsquo;s inspiration, by the Farm Bureau Federation in
July,
1920. It aimed to amalgamate all of wheat marketing into one
giant producers&rsquo; cooperative. The July conference appointed a
committee which produced, in the spring of 1921, a plan for a
huge national grain cooperative to be called U.S. Grain Growers,
Inc.<sup>13</sup> As almost always happens with voluntary
cartels, the new
organization bogged down almost immediately. Many local cooperative
farm elevators preferred dealing with existing private markets, and the
private grain exchanges successfully wooed the bulk
of the farmers into avoiding the new cartel. By early 1922, the
grandiose scheme had proven to be a complete failure.<sup>14</sup></p>




<p>The July 1920 conference also
tried to set up numerous other
national cartels&mdash;for national fruit marketing, dairy
marketing,
vegetable marketing, and wool marketing&mdash;and all but one were
quick failures. Only a livestock marketing plan had staying power,
and this because its aims were much less grandiose. Other Sapiro
failures were attempts at cotton and tobacco cartels. </p>



<p>These failures did not end the
cooperative movement, which
had to turn to less flamboyant and more gradual methods; but they
did show the folly of voluntary price-fixing. The next step was
almost inevitable&mdash;a determined call for compulsory
price-support
by the federal government. </p>



<p>A precedent had been set by the
wartime Food Administration
Grain Corporation, which had fixed high prices of wheat in order
to stimulate production and had itself distributed the wheat available.
Furthermore, the Hoover European food relief program of
1919, widely trumpeted as a humanitarian gesture, was also a
means of getting rid of &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; farm products and
thus bolstering food prices.<sup>15</sup> William H. Lyon,
a South Dakota attorney, now
proposed that the government fix a high price for every farm product
and buy up any unsold surplus. The Lyon Plan won the support
of Samuel Gompers, the South Dakota Assembly, many country
banks, and the Republican whip in the House of Representatives.
It was put forth as the Christopherson Bill in July, 1921, but failed
to win the support of the major farm organizations, as did other
price-support bills in this and immediately following years. But the
drive for compulsory price support had not begun in earnest. It
reached major importance in the &ldquo;Equality for
Agriculture&rdquo; movement, launched in the fall of 1921 by George
N. Peek and General
Hugh S. Johnson and backed by the powerful support of Bernard
M. Baruch. The idea was that since industry was protected by tariffs,
agriculture might as well join in mulcting the consumer. The
government was to maintain domestic farm prices at a high level,
buying the unsold surplus and selling it abroad at lower, worldmarket
levels. Both Peek and Johnson had direct economic interests in farm
subsidies as heads of the Moline Plow Company, manufacturers of
agricultural machinery. They found little difficulty in
interesting Secretary Wallace in their scheme, and the result was a
continuing agitation over McNary&ndash;Haugen bills, embodying the
plan, from 1924 through 1928. The first McNary&ndash;Haugen Bill
was
drawn up by Charles J. Brand, an executive of the American Fruit
Growers and former head of the Bureau of Markets in the USDA.
The original mass base of Peek&rsquo;s support was the marginal
wheat
farmers of the Northwest, backed by the bankers of that region.
Eugene Meyer, Jr. also lent his powerful backing. In 1924, Peek
established the American Council of Agriculture, with representatives
from the leading farm groups, to advocate his plan. By the
late 1920s, the mass farm organizations were solidly behind the
program.<sup>16</sup></p>



<p>It is true that President
Coolidge vetoed McNary&ndash;Haugen Bills
in 1927 and 1928, but it is also significant that he called upon
Eugene Meyer in 1926 to head a cotton corporation to try to keep
cotton prices from falling and that grants totaling $10 million were
made to government-sponsored farm organizations to buy cotton
at a certain price. Other countries&mdash;such as Canada, Hungary,
and
Poland&mdash;were also trying to keep up the price of wheat; but
the
threat of growing surpluses over the market had the reverse effect
and drove prices lower in 1928 and 1929, inducing a farm clamor
for more effective price support. </p>



<p>There were many other instances
of Coolidge intervention in
agriculture. In 1924, he supported the Norbeck&ndash;Burtness Bill
for
government loans to northwestern farmers for livestock purchases.
The bill failed to pass Congress, but Coolidge proceeded to
appoint a special agricultural commission, heavily weighted with
farm leaders. The commission&mdash;The President&rsquo;s
Agricultural
Conference&mdash;issued three reports during 1925. It recommended
further Farm Loan Board credits, further compulsory reduction of
freight rates, and large-scale subsidization of farm cooperatives
through a Federal Cooperative Marketing Board. The latter provision was
embodied in the Capper&ndash;Haugen Bill, which was however
defeated by the opposition of the farm coops, who objected to the
great degree of government regulation involved. Despite this
defeat, President Coolidge was more determined than ever to aid
the farm coops in any way that he could. Coolidge firmly believed
that government &ldquo;must encourage orderly and centralized
marketing&rdquo; in agriculture.<sup>17</sup> Herbert
Hoover and Secretary of Agriculture
William Jardine (a member of the President&rsquo;s Agricultural
Conference) agreed with Coolidge. In 1925, the Congress granted
additional funds for subsidizing the marketing research of farm
cooperatives, and the following year, prompted by Secretary Jardine, it
established a Division of Cooperative Marketing in the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics in the USDA. The new Division then
threw itself with enthusiasm into support of the farm coops. <i>This</i>
kind of intervention was of course welcomed by the coops. In
1926, Jardine sponsored the &ldquo;Jardine Plan&rdquo; for a
federal farm advisory council and a farmers&rsquo; marketing
commission to subsidize
cooperatives and to aid in marketing farm surpluses. The bill failed
to pass the House, which instead adopted the McNary&ndash;Haugen
Bill. The next year, the Coolidge administration brought out a
revised &ldquo;Jardine Plan,&rdquo; for a Farm Board, commodity
advisory
committees, and a set of stabilization corporations established by
the Board, with funds to lend to cooperatives. The new plan was
again sidetracked for another round in the McNary&ndash;Haugen
battle. </p>



<p>As Secretary of Commerce, Herbert
Hoover did a great deal to
subsidize farmers, and especially farm coops. He aided the latter in
many ways&mdash;solving their research and marketing problems,
helping find export markets for their produce, and making many
speeches on their behalf. He also supported tariffs for agricultural
produce. Furthermore, he was the man chiefly responsible for the
appointment of the strongly pro-cooperative Secretary Jardine.
Hoover had been one of the earliest proponents of a Federal Farm
Board to aid cooperative marketing associations, and he helped write
the Capper&ndash;Williams Bill of 1924 to that effect. And so it is
no surprise that, as Presidential candidate, Hoover advocated support
for
farm cooperatives and promised the farm bloc that he would soon
institute a farm-price support program. As soon as he took office, he
fulfilled both promises, In June 1929, the Agricultural Marketing
Act was passed, establishing the Federal Farm Board (FFB). </p>



<p>The new scheme was, in essence,
the old &ldquo;Jardine Plan.&rdquo; The
Federal Farm Board was furnished with $500 million by the Treasury and
was authorized to make all-purpose loans, up to a 20-year
period, to farm cooperatives at low interest rates. The Board could
also establish stabilization corporations to control farm surpluses
and bolster farm prices. Essentially, this was a Sapiro-type cartel,
this time backed by the coercive arm of the federal government.<sup>18</sup>
Hoover appointed, as chairman of the FFB, Alexander Legge,
president of International Harvester Co., and long-time
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of
Bernard M. Baruch. International Harvester was one of the leading
manufacturers of farm machinery, and therefore Legge, like
George Peek, had a direct economic interest in farm subsidization.
Other members of the FFB included the Secretary of Agriculture,
Arthur M. Hyde; James C. Stone, vice-chairman and founder of
the Burley Tobacco Growers&rsquo; Cooperative Association; Carl
Williams, a cotton grower of the Farmers&rsquo; Cooperative
Association; C.B. Denman of the National Livestock Producers&rsquo;
Association; C.C. Teague of the Fruit Growers&rsquo; Exchange;
William F.
Schilling of the National Dairy Association; Samuel McKelvie,
publisher of the <i>Nebraska Farmer</i>, representing the
grain interests;
and Charles S. Wilson, Professor of Agriculture at Cornell University.
It is clear that the Board was dominated by representatives
of the very farm cooperatives that it was organized to favor and
support.<sup>19</sup> Thus, the Hoover administration
established a giant agricultural cartel, directed by government, and
run by and for the
benefit of the cartellists themselves. </p>



<p>As the depression struck, the FFB
went into action. Its first big
operation was in wheat, prices of which had been falling sharply
for over a year. When first established, in August, the FFB advised
farmers not to send wheat forward to market too rapidly, but
rather to hold wheat in order to wait for higher prices. In September,
it made additional loans to cooperatives to withhold stocks and
raise prices. Yet the wheat price continued to fall sharply. On October
26, shortly after the stock market crash, the FFB announced
that it would lend $150 million to wheat coops, at up to 100 percent of
the market price, to try to hold up prices by keeping wheat
off the market. Soon after the stock market crash, the FFB established
a Farmers&rsquo; National Grain Corporation, with a capital of
$10 million, to centralize cooperative marketing in wheat and
other grains. The old dream of a wheat cartel had at last come true.
The FFB was supposed to work largely through such
&ldquo;corporations,&rdquo; or favored farm marketing
cooperatives; and the Farmers&rsquo;
National was selected to centralize all farmers&rsquo; grain
cooperatives,
eliminate competition among them, and thus stabilize and raise the
market price. At first, the FFB and Farmers&rsquo; National loaned
money to farm cooperatives to hold wheat off the market, then,
after prices continued to fall, the Farmers&rsquo; National itself
began to
buy wheat at the loan prices. </p>



<p>On November 25, Hoover organized
one of his inimitable
White House conferences with the major farm organizations, the
appointed heads of the FFB, the Land Banks, etc. The farm
organizations, like the unions, not surprisingly agreed with alacrity
to
cooperate with Hoover&rsquo;s program of massive subsidy to
themselves. </p>



<p>Whenever government intervenes in
the market, it aggravates
rather than settles the problems it has set out to solve. This is a
general economic law of government intervention. It is certainly
true for the overall Hoover depression policy. Nowhere has this
law been so clearly illustrated as in the American farm program
since 1929. The FFB managed to hold up wheat prices for a time.
Seeing this apparent success, wheat farmers naturally increased
their acreage, thus aggravating the surplus problem by the spring of
1930. Furthermore, as America held wheat off the market, it lost its
former share of the world&rsquo;s wheat trade. Yet, prices
continued to fall
as the months wore on, and the heavy 1930 acreage aggravated the
decline. The accumulating wheat surpluses in the hands of the FFB
frightened the market, and caused prices to tumble still further. </p>



<p>Julius Barnes, of the Chamber of
Commerce and the private
grain dealers, protested in vain against the unfair competition of
the Board and its pet cooperatives, since that competition was
directed against the private grain traders. The latter were
particularly incensed that the FFB charged the cooperatives a
subsidized,
lower-than-market interest rate on its loans. </p>



<p>In the spring of 1930, Hoover
acquired from Congress an
added $100 million to continue the FFB&rsquo;s lending and
purchasing
policies. But the farmers found themselves with increased surpluses,
and with prices still failing. Under farm bloc pressure,
Hoover then established the Grain Stabilization Corporation to
replace the Farmers&rsquo; National and to redouble stabilization
efforts.
The GSC concluded that individual wheat farmers had held off
wheat in the fall, and were &ldquo;profiteering&rdquo; by
selling wheat to the
GSC. To statists, individual profits are generally heinous, so the
FFB announced that from that point on, it would only support the
prices of wheat sold by cooperatives and the GSC. Under protests
of the grain trade, and the growingly evident impossibility of
supporting some wheat at one price while other wheat of the same
grade sold at another price, the FFB reversed its stand and decided
to support all wheat once more. </p>



<p>The FFB programs had thus
inadvertently encouraged greater
wheat production, only to find by spring that prices were falling
rapidly; greater surpluses threatened the market and spurred
greater declines. It became clear, in the impeccable logic of
government intervention, that the farmers would have to reduce their
wheat production, if they were to raise prices effectively. The FFB
was learning the lesson of every cartel&mdash;production must be
reduced in order to raise prices. And the logic of the
government&rsquo;s
farm monopoly also drove the FFB to conclude that farmers had
been &ldquo;overproducing.&rdquo; Secretary of Agriculture Hyde
accordingly
lectured the farmers on the evils of
&ldquo;overproduction.&rdquo; The Secretary and the FFB urged
farmers to reduce their acreage voluntarily. </p>



<p>The first group of farmers
selected to bear the brunt of this sacrifice were the marginal
Northwest growers of spring wheat&mdash;the
original agitators for price supports. They were not very happy at
the prospect. The farmers, after all, wanted subsidies from the
government; having to reduce their production of the subsidized
crop had not been included in their plans. A group of economists
left Washington at the end of March to try to persuade the Northwest
farmers that they would be better off if they shifted from
wheat to some other crop. In the meanwhile, in this topsy-turvy
world of interventionism, troubles piled up because the wheat crop
was abundant. Surpluses continued to accumulate, and wheat
prices continued to fall. Legge and Hyde toured the Middle West,
urging farmers to reduce their wheat acreage. Governor Reed of
Kansas reflected the common-sense view of the farmer when he
wondered why the government on the one hand promoted reclamation
projects to increase farm production and, on the other
hand, urged farmers to cut production.<sup>20</sup> Since
the individual
farmer would lose by cutting acreage, no amount of moral exhortation
could impel any substantial cut in wheat production. </p>



<p>As wheat piled up in useless
storage, foreign countries such as
Argentina and Russia increased their production, and this increase,
together with the general world depression, continued to drive
down wheat prices.<sup>21</sup> On June 30, 1930, the GSC
had accumulated
over 65 million bushels of wheat held off the market. Discouraged,
it did little until late 1930, and then, on November 15, the GSC
was authorized to purchase as much wheat as necessary to stop any
further decline in wheat prices. Bravely, the GSC bought 200 million
more bushels by mid-1931, but all to no avail. The forces of
world supply and demand could not be flouted so easily. Wheat
prices continued to fall, and wheat production continued to rise.
Finally, the FFB decided to dump wheat stocks abroad, and the
result was a drastic fall in market prices. By the end of the Hoover
administration, combined cotton and wheat losses by the FFB
totaled over $300 million, in addition to 85 million bushels of
wheat given <i>gratis</i> to the Red Cross. </p>



<p>The wheat program was the
FFB&rsquo;s major effort. The Board also
attempted several other programs, including a similar cartel in cotton.
In the fall of 1929, the FFB made substantial loans to cotton
cooperatives to stem the decline in cotton prices. These loans were
added to loans from the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks. But
cotton prices continued to fall, even after the American Cotton
Cooperative Association was encouraged to assume management
of the operation. Finally, in June 1930, the FFB established the
Cotton Stabilization Corporation (CSC) to try to stem the tide.
The CSC took over 1.25 million bales from the coops. Under
severe competition from external sources, the CSC announced
that it would maintain its holding for an entire year if prices did
not rise. But this proclamation, designed to firm the market, had
no effect. </p>



<p>Again, the cartel was confronted
with growing surpluses, and
therefore heavier pressure on farm prices. Finally, the FFB tried to
exhort the cotton farmers, too, to reduce acreage. Chairman Stone,
of the FFB, urged the governors of the cotton states to
&ldquo;immediately mobilize every interested and available agency .
. . to induce
immediate plowing under of every third row of cotton now
growing.&rdquo; This action stirred up a host of indignant
opposition, the <i>New
York Times</i> calling it &ldquo;one of the maddest things
that ever came
from an official body.&rdquo;<sup>22</sup> The proposal
met with no success; in fact
the 1931 cotton crop was considerably larger. In early 1932, the
Board then tried an heroic action&mdash;along with its 1.3 million
bales,
it obtained an agreement from southern bankers to withhold all of
their cotton (3.5 million bales), while it continued to finance 2.1
million bales held by the coops. This firmed prices until June 1932,
when they fell drastically again. By July, the Board had bought
$127 million worth of cotton, and it had lost over half of its value.
The upshot was that the CSC had to give up, and it began to liquidate
its cotton holdings in August, 1932, completing its unloading in a
year. The net loss of cotton was $16 million, in addition to
850,000 bales, worth over $78 million, donated to the Red Cross. </p>



<p>At the end of 1929, the FFB
established a national wool cooperative&mdash;the National Wool
Marketing Corporation (NWMC)
made up of 30 state associations. The Board also established an
allied National Wool Credit Corporation to handle finances. The
NWMC, unskilled in the affairs of the wool industry, turned over
its selling operations to the private woolen handling firm, the
Draper Company. The NWMC made huge advances to wool
growers from 1930 on, thereby concentrating a large part of the
domestic wool output in the hands of the NWMC, and the FFB
loaned heavily to its creature. While prices firmed at the beginning,
they kept drifting inexorably downward, and the NWMC
program only served to stimulate a greater production of wool.
The overhanging surplus depressed prices further, and overextended the
funds of the NWMC. Eventually, the NWMC had to
sell its huge stock of wool at very low prices, thus aggravating the
wool price problem still further. A total of $31.5 million in loans
for wool were made by the FFB, of which $12.5 million were permanently
lost. </p>



<p>In October, 1929, the FFB set up
the National Livestock Marketing Association, but the livestock
producers disagreed and set
up conflicting cooperatives, and the program was never launched
on any considerable scale. The FFB also organized a dairy program, with
five regional butter-marketing associations, providing aid
to dairy cooperatives. An advisory committee angered the farmers
by suggesting that they reduce the size of their dairy herds in order
to cut the surpluses in dairy production. The farmers preferred to
lobby for legislation to outlaw oleomargarine or to prevent imports
of cocoanut oil from the Philippines.<sup>23</sup> Other
FFB attempts were a
National Bean Marketing Association; a National Pecan Marketing
Association, established in February, 1930; aid to citrus industries,
as well as to figs, grapes and raisins, potatoes, apples, sugarbeets,
honey, nuts, maple syrup, tobacco, poultry, eggs, and rice.
However, the Board only tried fully to stabilize prices in wheat and
cotton, where it failed ignominiously. Similar attempts, on a
smaller scale, were made in butter, wool, and grapes, while FFB
activity for the other crops was confined to subsidizing existing
cooperatives. The grape stabilization program was a fiasco like the
others. The California Grape Control Board lasted for two years,
from 1930 to 1932, and then collapsed, with grape growers unwilling to
pay stabilization fees. In the meanwhile, the Federal Prohibition
Administration aggravated conditions in the industry by
outlawing grape concentrates. By May, 1933, total federal loans for
grapes were $25 million, with substantial losses. </p>



<p>In butter, the FFB granted loans
to existing regional dairy
cooperatives and stimulated interregional agreements between
them. The most important was Land O&rsquo;Lakes Creameries, Inc.,
in
the North Central states. The Board granted a loan to Land
O&rsquo;Lakes in January, 1930, to steady the price of butter by
withholding some stock from the market. Prices firmed for a time, but
then fell later as the stocks were sold. It is difficult to trace the
effect of this operation because it was conducted on a rather small
scale.<sup>24</sup> In tobacco, the FFB tried to stimulate
cooperatives, which
had become dormant in this industry. The Board advanced loans,
but the 1931 crop was large and the price lower. The new cooperative
folded in the next year. </p>



<p>And so the grandiose
stabilization effort of the FFB failed ignominiously. Its loans
encouraged greater production, adding to its
farm surpluses, which overhung the market, driving prices down
both on direct and on psychological grounds. The FFB thus aggravated
the very farm depression that it was supposed to solve. With
the FFB generally acknowledged a failure, President Hoover
began to pursue the inexorable logic of government intervention
to the next step: recommending that productive land be withdrawn
from cultivation, that crops be plowed under, and that immature
farm animals be slaughtered&mdash;all to reduce the very surpluses
that
government&rsquo;s prior intervention had brought into being. It
was left
to the Roosevelt administration, however, to carry out the next
great logical step down the road to a wholly socialized
agriculture&mdash;
an agriculture socialized, we might add, on principles of irrationality
and destruction.<sup>25</sup></p>



<p>With the failure of the FFB, the
leading farm organizations met
in Washington, in January, 1932, and called for a program of effective
control of farm surpluses, outlawing of short-selling in commodities, a
stable currency, and independence for the Philippines
in order to stop duty free imports from that territory. But nothing
was accomplished in the Congress, even though several Congressmen
introduced bills for more extensive farm aid. At this point,
some radical farmers decided to call a &ldquo;farmers&rsquo;
strike&rdquo; in an
attempted price-support program of their own. Falling farm prices
were to be combated by withholding farm produce. The leader of
this &ldquo;Farm Holiday&rdquo; movement was Milo Reno, head of
the Iowa
Farmers Union and the Farm Holiday Association. Reno, an old
radical and a preacher, had been calling for such
&ldquo;strike&rdquo; measures
since 1920. Now, on May 3, a convention of 3000 Iowa farmers led
by Reno voted to call a strike on July 4. Their slogan: &ldquo;Stay
at
Home&mdash;Buy Nothing, Sell Nothing,&rdquo; and their song: </p>



<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call a
Farmers&rsquo; Holiday<br/>



A Holiday let&rsquo;s hold<br/>



We&rsquo;ll eat our wheat and ham and eggs<br/>



And let them eat their gold.&rdquo; </p>



<p>This self-destructive threat to
return to a barter economy was
originally supposed to last a month as a warning to the rest of
society. But, by the fall of 1932, the movement had become a continuing
mob. Centering in Sioux City, Iowa, the movement spread, and
state units were formed in North and South Dakota, Minnesota,
Montana, and there was agitation in Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska,
and Kansas; but the units did not form a very cohesive front. The
farmers soon shifted from attempts to persuade their fellows to
outright physical violence. As is often, the case, when the strikers
found that they were starving due to their own policies, while their
non-striking colleagues were thriving, they attempted to force the
hated &ldquo;scabs&rdquo; to lose <i>their</i>
income as well. In August, in Sioux City,
scene of the first farm strike, strikers blockaded roads, used guns to
enforce their commands, stoned buildings, and forcibly stopped
transportation.<sup>26</sup> Strikers formed their own
aggressive private
army, the Khaki Shirts of America. And Governor Floyd Olson of
Minnesota offered to use the state militia to enforce an embargo
on the &ldquo;export&rdquo; of all farm produce from his state,
provided that all
the other farm-state governors would join. Happily, his offer was
refused. All this agitation failed to raise prices; in fact, more goods
flowed in from non-striking (largely non-Iowa) sources, and prices
continued to fall rapidly. By the end of 1932, the farmers&rsquo;
holiday
movement had ended&mdash;with the exception of North Dakota,
where a farmers&rsquo; convention urged farmers to organize a
council of
defense, and to strike and refuse to farm for the market until prices
had risen to the farms&rsquo; cost of production. </p>



<p>Although they failed in their
main objective, the farm councils
managed to scale down farm mortgages, worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars, and farmers also organized &ldquo;penny sales,&rdquo;
where
they forcibly barred other than a bankrupt farmer&rsquo;s friends
from
attending the auction sale of his goods. The friends would buy the
goods for a &ldquo;penny,&rdquo; and then return it to the
bankrupt. The low
point of this criminality occurred in April, 1933, when a gang
assaulted and almost hung an Iowa county judge for refusing to
agree to their demand that he order no more farm foreclosures.<sup>27</sup>
</a><a name="link9">And in February, 1933, Governor
Olson, under threat from radical farmers of his state to march on the
Minnesota capitol to
demand compulsory debt moratoria, actually decreed a halt to all
foreclosures.</p>
