	Various neo-Keynesians have advanced cycle theories. They are
	integrated,
	however, not with <i>general</i> economic theory, but with
	holistic Keynesian systems&mdash;
	systems which are very <i>partial</i> indeed.</p>

	Haberler&rsquo;s wellknown discussion. See Gottfried Haberler, <i>Prosperity
	and Depression </i>(2nd ed.,

	<i>Journal of Political Economy</i>(April, 1930):
	127&ndash;28.</p>


	<blockquote><p>Under conditions of free competition . . . the market is . . .
	dependent
	upon supply and demand . . . there could [not] develop a
	disproportionality in the production of goods, which could draw in the
	whole economic
	system . . . such a disproportionality can arise only when, at some
	decisive
	point, the price structure does not base itself upon the play of only
	free
	competition, so that some arbitrary influence becomes
	possible.</p></blockquote>


	<p>Kuznets
	himself criticizes the Austrian theory from his empiricist, anti-cause
	and effect-standpoint, and also erroneously considers this theory to be
	&ldquo;static.&rdquo;</p>

	This is the &ldquo;pure time preference theory&rdquo; of the
	rate of interest; it can be
	found in Ludwig von Mises, <i>Human Action </i>(New
	Haven, Conn.: Yale University
	Press, 1949); in Frank A. Fetter, <i>Economic Principles </i>(New
	York: Century, 1915),
	and idem<i>,</i> &ldquo;Interest Theories Old and New,<i>&rdquo;

	&ldquo;Banks,&rdquo; for many purposes, include also savings
	and loan associations, and
	life insurance companies, both of which create new money via credit
	expansion to
	business. See below for further discussion of the money and banking
	question. </p>

	credit, see F.A. Hayek, <i>Prices and Production </i>(2nd

	B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, &ldquo;Positive
	Theory of Capital,&rdquo; in <i>Capital and Interest </i>(South
	Holland, Ill.: Libertarian Press,
	1959), vol. 2.</p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-8"><sup>8</sup></a>&ldquo;Inflation&rdquo;
	is here defined as an <i>increase in the money supply not
	consisting of an
	increase in the money metal.</i></p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-9"><sup>9</sup></a>
	This &ldquo;Austrian&rdquo; cycle theory settles the ancient
	economic controversy on
	whether or not changes in the quantity of money can affect the rate of
	interest. It
	supports the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; doctrine that an increase in
	the quantity of money lowers
	the rate of interest (if it first enters the loan market); on the other
	hand, it supports
	the classical view that, in the long run, quantity of money does not
	affect the interest rate (or can only do so if time preferences
	change). In fact, the depression-readjustment is the market&rsquo;s
	return to the desired free-market rate of interest.&nbsp;</p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-10"><sup>10</sup></a>It
	is often
	maintained that since business firms can find few profitable
	opportunities in a depression, business demand for loans falls off, and
	hence loans and money
	supply will contract. But this argument
	overlooks
	the fact that the
	banks, if they want to, can purchase securities, and thereby sustain
	the money
	supply by increasing their investments to compensate for dwindling
	loans.
	Contractionist pressure therefore always stems from banks and not from
	business
	borrowers. </p>


	<p><a name="Note-1-11"><sup>11</sup></a>
	Banks are &ldquo;inherently bankrupt&rdquo; because they issue
	far more warehouse
	receipts to cash (nowadays in the form of
	&ldquo;deposits&rdquo; redeemable in cash on
	demand) than they have cash available. Hence, they are always
	vulnerable to bank
	runs. These runs are not like any other business failures, because they
	simply consist of depositors claiming their own rightful property,
	which the banks do not
	have. &ldquo;Inherent bankruptcy,&rdquo; then, is an essential
	feature of any &ldquo;fractional
	reserve&rdquo; banking system. As Frank Graham stated: </p>


	<blockquote><p>The
	attempt of the banks to realize the inconsistent aims of
	lending cash,
	or merely multiplied claims to cash, and still to represent that cash
	is available on demand is even more preposterous than . . . eating
	one&rsquo;s cake and
	counting on it for future consumption. . . . The alleged convertibility
	is a
	delusion dependent upon the right&rsquo;s not being unduly
	exercised.</p></blockquote>

	Proposal,&rdquo;
	<i>American Economic Review </i>(September, 1936): 436.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p><a name="Note-1-12"><sup>12</sup></a>
	In a gold standard country (such as America during the 1929
	depression),
	Austrian economists accepted credit contraction as a perhaps necessary
	price to
	pay for remaining on gold. But few saw any remedial virtues in the
	deflation
	process itself. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-13"><sup>13</sup></a>
	Some readers may ask: why doesn&rsquo;t credit contraction lead to
	malinvestment, by causing overinvestment in lower-order goods and
	underinvestment in
	higher-order goods, thus reversing the consequences of credit
	expansion? The
	answer stems from the Austrian analysis of the structure of production.
	There is
	no arbitrary choice of investing in lower or higher-order goods. Any
	increased
	investment <i>must</i> be made in the higher-order goods,
	must lengthen the structure
	of production. A decreased amount of investment in the economy simply
	reduces
	higher-order capital. Thus, credit contraction will cause <i>not</i>
	excess of investment in the lower
	orders, but simply a shorter
	structure than would otherwise have
	been established. </p>




	<p><a name="Note-1-14"><sup>14</sup></a>In
	a gold standard economy, credit
	contraction
	is limited by the total size of
	the gold stock. </p>


	
	<p><a name="Note-1-15"><sup>15</sup></a>
	In recent years, particularly in the literature on the
	&ldquo;under-developed countries,&rdquo; there has been a great
	deal of discussion of government &ldquo;investment.&rdquo;
	There can be no such investment, however.
	&ldquo;Investment&rdquo; is defined as expenditures made not
	for the direct satisfaction of those who make it, but for other,
	ultimate consumers. Machines are produced not to serve the
	entrepreneur, but to
	serve the ultimate consumers, who in turn remunerate the entrepreneurs.
	But
	government acquires its funds by seizing them from private individuals;
	the
	spending of the funds, therefore, gratifies the desires of <i>government
	officials.</i>
	Government officials have forcibly shifted production from satisfying
	private
	consumers to satisfying themselves; their spending is therefore pure
	consumption
	and can by no stretch of the term be called
	&ldquo;investment.&rdquo; (Of course, to the extent
	that government officials do not realize this, their
	&ldquo;consumption&rdquo; is really <i>waste</i>-
	spending.)&nbsp;
	</p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-16"><sup>16</sup></a>For
	more on the problems of
	fractional-reserve
	banking, see below. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-17"><sup>17</sup></a>
	See W.H. Hutt, &ldquo;The Significance of Price
	Flexibility,&rdquo; in Henry Hazlitt,
	ed., <i>The Critics of Keynesian Economics </i>(Princeton,
	N.J.: D. Van Nostrand, 1960),
	pp. 390&ndash;92. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-18"><sup>18</sup></a>
	I am indebted to Mr. Rae C. Heiple, II, for pointing this out to me. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-19"><sup>19</sup></a>Could
	government increase the
	investment&ndash;consumption ratio by <i> raising</i>
	taxes in any way? It could not tax <i>only</i> consumption
	even if it tried; it can be shown
	(and Prof. Harry Gunnison Brown has gone a long way to show) that any
	ostensible tax on &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; becomes, on the
	market, a tax on incomes, hurting
	saving as well as consumption. If we assume that the poor consume a
	greater proportion of their income than the rich, we might say that a
	tax on the poor used to
	subsidize the rich will raise the saving&ndash;consumption ratio
	and thereby help cure
	a depression. On the other hand, the poor do not necessarily have
	higher time
	preferences than the rich, and the rich might well treat government
	subsidies as
	special windfalls to be consumed. Furthermore, Harold Lubell has
	maintained
	that the effects of a <i>change </i>in income
	distribution on social consumption would be
	negligible, even though the absolute proportion of consumption is
	greater among
	the poor. See Harry Gunnison Brown, &ldquo;The Incidence of a
	General Output or a
	General Sales Tax,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Political Economy</i>(April,
	1939): 254&ndash;62; Harold
	Lubell, &ldquo;Effects of Redistribution of Income on
	Consumers&rsquo; Expenditures,&rdquo;

	157&ndash;70.&nbsp;</p>




	<p><a name="Note-1-20"><sup>20</sup></a>
	Advocacy of any governmental policy must rest, in the final analysis,
	on a
	system of ethical principles. We do not attempt to discuss ethics in
	this book.
	Those who <i>wish </i>to prolong a depression, for
	whatever reason, will, of course,
	enthusiastically support these government interventions, as will those
	whose
	prime aim is the accretion of power in the hands of the state. </p>

	the classic treatment of
	hyperinflation,

	Turroni, <i>The Economics of Inflation</i> (London: George
	Allen and Unwin, 1937). </p>

	<p><a name="Note-1-23"><sup>23</sup></a>
	When gold&mdash;formerly the banks&rsquo; reserves&mdash;is
	transferred to a newly established Central Bank, the latter keeps only
	a fractional reserve, and thus the total
	credit base and potential monetary supply are enlarged. See C.A.
	Phillips, T.F.
	McManus, and R.W. Nelson,<i> Banking and the Business Cycle </i>(New
	York:
	Macmillan, 1937), pp. 24ff. </p>




	<p><a name="Note-1-24"><sup>24</sup></a>
	Many &ldquo;state banks&rdquo; were induced to join the FRS by
	patriotic appeals and
	offers of free services. Even the banks that did not join, however, are
	effectively
	controlled by the System, for, in order to obtain paper money, they
	must keep
	reserves in some member bank. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
	The average reserve requirements of all banks before 1913 was estimated
	at
	approximately 21 percent. By mid-1917, when the FRS had fully taken
	shape, the
	average required ratio was 10 percent. Phillips et al. estimate that
	the inherent
	inflationary impact of the FRS (pointed out in footnote 23) increased
	the expansive power of the banking system three-fold. Thus, the two
	factors (the inherent
	impact, and the deliberate lowering of reserve requirements) combined
	to inflate
	the monetary potential of the American banking system six-fold as a
	result of the
	inauguration of the FRS. See Phillips, et al.<i>, Banking and the
	Business Cycle, </i>pp. 23ff. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-26"><sup>26</sup></a>
	The horrors of &ldquo;wildcat banking&rdquo; in America before
	the Civil War stemmed
	from two factors, both due to government rather than free banking: (1)
	Since the
	beginnings of banking, in 1814 and then in every ensuing panic, state
	governments permitted banks to continue operating, making and calling
	loans, etc. without having to redeem in specie. In short, banks were
	privileged to operate without paying their obligations. (2)
	Prohibitions on interstate branch banking (which
	still exist), coupled with poor transportation, prevented banks from
	promptly calling on distant banks for redemption of notes. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-27"><sup>27</sup></a>
	Mises, <i>Human Action, </i>p. 440.&nbsp;</p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-28"><sup>28</sup></a>A
	common analogy states that banks
	simply
	count on people not redeeming
	all their property at once, and that engineers who build bridges
	operate also on the principle that not everyone in a city will
	wish to cross
	the bridge at once. But
	the cases are entirely different. The people crossing a bridge are
	simply requesting a service; <i>they are not trying to take
	possession of their lawful property, </i>as are the
	bank depositors. A more fitting analogy would defend embezzlers who
	would
	never have been caught if someone hadn&rsquo;t fortuitously
	inspected the books. The
	crime comes when the theft or fraud is <i>committed</i>,
	not when it is finally revealed.</p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-29"><sup>29</sup></a>
	Perhaps a libertarian legal system would consider &ldquo;general
	deposit warrants&rdquo; (which allow a warehouse to return any
	homogeneous good to the depositor) as &ldquo;specific deposit
	warrants,&rdquo; which, like bills of lading, pawn tickets,
	dockwarrants, etc. establish ownership to specific, earmarked objects.
	As Jevons stated, &ldquo;It used to be held as a general rule of
	law, that any present grant or assignment of goods not in existence is
	without operation.&rdquo; See W. Stanley Jevons,
	<i>Money and the Mechanism of Exchange </i>(London: Kegan
	Paul, 1905), pp. 207&ndash;12.
	For an excellent discussion of the problems of a fractional-reserve
	money, see
	Amasa Walker, <i>The Science of Wealth </i>(3rd ed.,
	Boston: Little, Brown, 1867), pp.
	126&ndash;32, esp. pp. 139&ndash;41.</p>






	<p><a name="Note-1-30"><sup>30</sup></a>
	Some writers make a great to-do over the legal fiction that the Federal
	Reserve System is &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by its member banks. In
	practice, this simply means
	that these banks are taxed to help pay for the support of the Federal
	Reserve. If
	the private banks really &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Fed, then how
	can its officials be appointed by
	the government, and the &ldquo;owners&rdquo; compelled to
	&ldquo;own&rdquo; the Federal Reserve
	Board by force of government statute? The Federal Reserve Banks should
	simply
	be regarded as governmental agencies. </p>

	See Mises, <i>Human Action, </i>pp. 576&ndash;78.
	Professor Hayek, in his well-known
	(and excellent) exposition of the Austrian theory, had early shown how
	the theory fully applies to credit expansion amidst unemployed factors.

	Production, </i>pp. 96&ndash;99. </p>

	Mises, <i>Human Action, </i>pp. 556&ndash;57. Mises
	also refutes the old notion that the
	boom is characterized by an undue conversion of &ldquo;circulating
	capital&rdquo; into &ldquo;fixed
	capital.&rdquo; If that were true, then the crisis would reveal a
	shortage of circulating
	capital, and would greatly drive up the prices of, e.g., industrial raw
	materials. Yet,
	these materials are precisely among the ones revealed by the crisis to
	be overabundant, i.e., resources were malinvested in
	&ldquo;circulating&rdquo; as well as in
	&ldquo;fixed&rdquo;
	capital in the higher stages of production. </p>

	side, see the brief comments of Mises, <i>Human Action, </i>pp.

	et al.,<i> Banking and the Business Cycle, </i>pp. 139ff. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-1-36"><sup>36</sup></a>
	The error of the followers stems from their failure to adopt the pure
	timepreference theory of interest of Fetter and Mises, and their
	clinging to eclectic
	&ldquo;productivity&rdquo; elements in their explanation of
	interest. See the references mentioned in footnote 5 above. </p>




	<p><a name="Note-1-37"><sup>37</sup></a>
	Mises points out (<i>Human Action, </i>p. 789n.) that if
	the banks simply lowered
	the interest charges on their loans without expanding their credit,
	they would be
	granting gifts to debtors, and would not be generating a business
	cycle. </p>

	Walker, <i>The Science of Wealth, </i>pp. 145ff.; also
	see p. 159.<br>



	[B]anks must be constantly desirous of increasing their loans, by
	issuing
	their own credit in the shape of circulation and deposits. The more
	they
	can get out, the larger the income. This is the <i>motive power </i>that
	ensures
	the constant expansion of a mixed [fractional reserve] currency to its
	highest possible limit. The banks will always increase their
	indebtedness when
	they can, and only contract it when they must.</p>
