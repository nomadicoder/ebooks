	<h3>Appendix: Government
	and the
	National Product, 1929&ndash;1932</h3>


	</div>



	<p><font size="+2"><b>I</b></font>n footnote 21 of Chapter 9, we
	explain how we arrive at our
	estimate of the degree of government depredation on the private
	national product. The critical assumption is the challenge
	to the orthodox postulate that
	government spending,
	<i> ipso facto</i>,
	represents a net addition to the national product. This is a clearly
	distorted view. Spending only measures value of output in the private
	economy because that spending is voluntary for services rendered. In
	government, the situation is entirely different: government acquires
	its money by coercion, and its spending has no necessary relation to
	the services that it might be providing to the private sector. There is
	no way, in fact, to gauge these services. Furthermore, every
	government-conscripted dollar deprives the citizen of expenditures he
	would rather have made. It is therefore far
	more realistic to make the <i>opposite</i> assumption, as
	we do here, that
	all government spending is a clear depredation upon, rather than
	an addition to, private product and private output. Any person who
	believes that there <i>is more than 50 percent</i> waste in
	government will
	have to grant that our assumption is more realistic than the standard
	one. </p>



	<p>To estimate the extent of
	government depredation on private
	product, we first find private product by deducting
	&ldquo;product&rdquo; or
	&ldquo;income&rdquo; originating in government and
	&ldquo;government enterprise&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., the payment
	of government salaries&mdash;from Gross
	National Product. We now have the Gross Private Product. Government
	depredations upon this GPP consist of the resources that
	<!--><i>339</i><-->
	government drains from the
	private sector, i.e., total government
	expenditures or receipts, whichever is the higher. This total
	subtracted from the GPP yields the private product remaining in private
	hands, which we may call PPR. The percentage of government depredation
	to gross private product yields an estimate of the
	burden of government&rsquo;s fiscal operations on the private
	economy.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-A-1">1 </a></sup></font></p>



	<p>If government expenditure is
	larger than receipts, then the
	deficit is a drain on private resources&mdash;whether financed by
	issuing
	new money or by borrowing private savings&mdash;and therefore the
	expenditure figure is chosen as a measure of government depredation of
	the private sector. If receipts are larger, then the surplus
	drains the private sector through taxes, and receipts may be considered
	the burden on the private sector.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-A-2">2</a></sup></font></p>



	<p>One significant problem created
	by the vagaries of the official
	statistics&mdash;fortunately, again, a problem not significant for
	our
	period&mdash;is that the official statistics lump together the bulk
	of the
	spending of government<i> enterprises</i> (roughly, the
	government
	agencies that charge fees) in the private, rather than the
	governmental, sector. There are, therefore, no figures available for
	the
	total spending or total receipts of government
	enterprises&mdash;although
	there <i>are</i> separate figures for the salaries paid
	by, the &ldquo;income originating in,&rdquo; government
	enterprises. Below, we will present very
	rough estimates for government enterprises for these years. </p>
	
	
	
	<p>Furthermore, we do not, as do
	the Department of Commerce
	accounts of government expenditures, deduct government interest
	<i>received</i> from interest paid by government, to arrive
	at a &ldquo;net interest
	paid&rdquo; figure. On the contrary, the full amount paid by
	government is
	deducted from private resources and must therefore be included;
	while &ldquo;interest received&rdquo; is a receipt from the
	private sector, and
	should be included in the estimation of government receipts. </p>



	<p>We are presenting here the
	figures not only for gross product, but
	also for net product, which are also of interest. Net National Product
	is Gross National Product minus depreciation and other capital
	consumption allowances, and if we consider private product as net
	income without drain on the value of capital, then we should estimate
	the percentage of government depredation on net private product.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-A-3">3</a></sup></font></p>

	and Net National Product in current prices. (Figures in this and
	following tables are from <p><i>U.S. Income and Output</i>

	<p>Estimates of the expenditure of
	government enterprises are
	divisible into two parts: income originating (i.e., employee
	salaries), which are available from the Department of Commerce,
	and purchases from business, which are not available at all. Neither
	the Department of Commerce nor the Treasury has any figures
	available for purchases from business. The only estimates we may
	obtain, therefore, must be highly sketchy and arbitrary. Professor
	Fabricant has prepared figures for the <i>fiscal</i> year
	1932 (we have so
	far been dealing in calendar years) of the total purchases from
	business by federal and state and local governments, <i>including</i>
	government enterprise.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-A-4">4</a></sup></font> Fabricant estimates
	total Federal purchases from
	business, general government <i>and</i> government
	enterprise, as $1.02
	billion for 1931&ndash;32. The average of the Department of
	Commerce
	figure of Federal government (general) purchases from business
	for 1931 and 1932 is $.54 billion. We may therefore estimate the
	expenditure by Federal <i>enterprises</i> on goods from
	business as $.48
	billion for 1931&ndash;32. </p>



	<p>On the state and local level,
	Fabricant estimates a total of $4.08
	billion spent by government and government enterprise on business
	products in 1931&ndash;32; the average of 1931&ndash;1932 for
	general
	state and local government purchases from business is $3.48 billion
	(Department of Commerce). This leaves as the estimate for
	1931&ndash;1932 of purchases of government enterprises, state and
	local,
	from business at $.60 billion. </p>



	<p>Unfortunately, Fabricant
	presents no figures for any other years
	for our period on the state and local level. For Federal purchases
	from business, Fabricant estimates the total, for government and
	government enterprise, at $.88 billion for <i>fiscal</i>
	1929. Now, unfortunately, we have no data for 1928; using calendar year
	1929, therefore, we obtain $.36 billion as the Department of Commerce
	estimate for Federal government (general) purchases. Subtracting this
	from the Fabricant figure, we obtain a rough estimate of $.52 billion
	for the purchases of Federal enterprises from business during 1929.</p>



	<p>To extrapolate these sketchy
	figures into estimates of federal, and
	state and local, government enterprises for each of these years is
	certainly arbitrary, but it would just as certainly be <i>more</i>
	arbitrary if we
	simply ignored the problem altogether, and permitted government
	enterprises to remain partially ensconced in the private sector. We
	will therefore assume that, for each of our years, Federal enterprises
	spent $.5 billion on the products of business, while state and local
	enterprises spent $.6 billion. Our estimates for the expenditures of
	government enterprises are then as follows in <a href="#Table-V">Table V</a>. </p>

	<p>What were governmental receipts
	during these years? Here we
	may take the Department of Commerce data, adding to them for both
	federal and state and local, &ldquo;interest received.&rdquo;
	As for government 
	enterprises, we may simply and
	roughly assume that their receipts
	balanced their expenditures, and estimate them in the same way,
	<i>except</i> that we know from the Department of Commerce
	the current surplus of state and local government enterprises, which we
	may add to the receipt figure. Total estimated receipts of government
	and government enterprise are presented in <a href="#Table-VII">Table VII</a>. It
	might be thought that, to arrive at the highest aggregate figure of
	government expenditures or receipts for any year, we simply total
	federal and state and local receipts, and the same for expenditures,
	and see which one is the higher. This is not correct, however. Whenever
	we have independent centers of governmental 	
	activity, the deficits and
	surpluses of these centers do <i>not</i> cancel
	each other in their impact on the private economy. Suppose
	hypothetically, that, in a given year the Illinois state government has
	a
	fiscal surplus of $200 million, while New York has a deficit of $200
	million. If we are interested in a figure for the governmental
	impact of New York and Illinois states combined, we do <i>not</i>
	simply
	aggregate receipts and expenditures and compare them. For
	Illinois&rsquo;s surplus taxes drain the private sector, and New
	York&rsquo;s deficits
	also drain the private sector. The ideal step, therefore, is to take
	each state&rsquo;s and each locality&rsquo;s receipts or
	expenditures, whichever
	is the higher, and add up each of these <i>higher</i>
	figures, along with
	the higher figure for the Federal budget, to estimate the total fiscal
	impact of all level of government. With the data we have available, we
	can only do this for state and local on the one hand, and
	Federal on the other.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-A-5">5</a></sup></font></p>

	<p>We see here, in stark relief, the record
	of the enormous increase
	in the fiscal burden of government during the depression, from 
	1929 to 1932. The percentage of
	Federal depredations on the private product rose from approximately 5
	percent to 8 percent of the
	GPP, and from 6 percent to 10 percent of the NPP; state and local
	depredations rose from 9 percent to 16 percent of the GPP, and
	from 10 to 19 percent of the NPP. Total government depredations
	rose from 14 percent to 25 percent of GPP, and from 16 percent
	to 29 percent of NPP, not far from double the burden!</p>
