<h3>Prelude to Depression: Mr. Hoover and Laissez-Faire </h3>


</b>

</div>



<p><font size="+2"><b>I</b></font>f government wishes to alleviate,
rather than aggravate, a
depression, its only valid course is laissez-faire&mdash;to leave
the
economy alone. Only if there is no interference, direct or
threatened, with prices, wage
rates, and business liquidation will
the necessary adjustment proceed with smooth dispatch. Any
propping up of shaky positions postpones liquidation and aggravates
unsound conditions. Propping up wage rates creates mass
unemployment, and bolstering prices perpetuates and creates
unsold surpluses. Moreover, a drastic cut in the government
budget&mdash;both in taxes and expenditures&mdash;will of
itself speed
adjustment by changing social choice toward more saving and
investment relative to consumption. For government spending,
whatever the label attached to it, is solely consumption; any cut in
the budget therefore raises the investment&ndash;consumption ratio
in
the economy and allows more rapid validation of originally wasteful and
loss-yielding projects. Hence, the proper injunction to government in a
depression is cut the budget and leave the economy
strictly alone. Currently fashionable economic thought considers
such a <i>dictum</i>hopelessly outdated; instead, it has
more substantial
backing now in economic law than it did during the nineteenth
century. </p>



<p>Laissez-faire was, roughly, the
traditional policy in American
depressions before 1929. The laissez-faire precedent was set in
America&rsquo;s first great
depression, 1819, when the federal government&rsquo;s only act was
to ease terms of payment for its own land
debtors. President Van Buren also set a staunch laissez-faire
course, in the Panic of 1837. Subsequent federal governments followed a
similar path, the chief sinners being state governments
which periodically permitted insolvent banks to continue in operation
without paying their obligations.<sup><a href="#Note-7-1">1</a></sup> In the
1920&ndash;1921 depression, government intervened to a greater
extent, but wage rates
were permitted to fall, and government expenditures and taxes
were reduced. And this depression was over in one year&mdash;in
what
Dr. Benjamin M. Anderson has called &ldquo;our last natural
recovery to
full employment.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Laissez-faire, then, was the
policy dictated both by sound theory and by historical precedent. But
in 1929, the sound course was
rudely brushed aside. Led by President Hoover, the government
embarked on what Anderson has accurately called the &ldquo;Hoover
New Deal.&rdquo; For if we define &ldquo;New Deal&rdquo; as
an antidepression program marked by extensive governmental economic
planning and
intervention&mdash;including bolstering of wage rates and prices,
expansion of credit, propping up of weak firms, and increased
government spending (e.g., subsidies to unemployment and public
works)&mdash;Herbert Clark Hoover must be considered the founder of
the New Deal in America. Hoover, from the very start of the
depression, set his course unerringly toward the violation of all the
laissez-faire canons. As a consequence, he left office with the economy
at the depths of an unprecedented depression, with no recovery in sight
after three and a half years, and with unemployment at
the terrible and unprecedented rate of 25 percent of the labor
force. </p>



<p>Hoover&rsquo;s role as
founder of a revolutionary program of government planning to combat
depression has been unjustly neglected
by historians. Franklin D. Roosevelt, in large part, merely elaborated
the policies laid down by his predecessor. To scoff at
Hoover&rsquo;s tragic failure to cure the depression as a typical
example
of laissez-faire is drastically to misread the historical record. The
Hoover rout must be set down as a failure of government planning
and not of the free market. </p>



<p>To portray the interventionist
efforts of the Hoover administration to cure the depression we may
quote Hoover&rsquo;s own summary of his program, during his
Presidential campaign in the fall
of 1932



<blockquote>we might have done nothing. That
would have been
utter ruin. Instead we met the situation with proposals
to private business and to Congress of the most gigantic
program of economic defense and counterattack ever
evolved in the history of the Republic. We put it into
action. . . . No government in Washington has hitherto
considered that it held so broad a responsibility for leadership in
such times. . . . For the first time in the history
of depression, dividends, profits, and the cost of living,
have been reduced before wages have suffered. . . . They
were maintained until the cost of living had decreased
and the profits had practically vanished. They are now
the highest real wages in the world. </p>



<p>Creating new jobs and giving to
the whole system a
new breath of life; nothing has ever been devised in our
history which has done more for . . . &ldquo;the common run
of men and women.&rdquo; Some of the reactionary economists urged
that we should allow the liquidation to take
its course until we had found bottom. . . . We determined that we would
not follow the advice of the bitterend liquidationists and see the
whole body of debtors of
the United States brought to bankruptcy and the savings
of our people brought to destruction.<sup><a href="#Note-7-2">2</a></sup></p>



<center><h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOOVER&rsquo;S INTERVENTIONISM: UNEMPLOYMENT</h3></center>

<p>Hoover, of course, did not come
upon his interventionist ideas
suddenly. It is instructive to trace their development and the similar
development in the country as a whole, if we are to understand
clearly how Hoover could so easily, and with such nationwide support,
reverse the policies that had ruled in all previous depressions. </p>



<p>Herbert Clark Hoover was very
much the &ldquo;forward-looking&rdquo;
politician. We have seen that Hoover pioneered in attempts to
intimidate investment bankers in placing foreign loans. Characteristic
of all Hoover&rsquo;s interventions was the velvet glove on the
mailed fist: i.e., the businessmen would be exhorted to adopt
&ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; measures that the government desired,
but implicit was
the threat that if business did not &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo;
properly, compulsory controls would soon follow. </p>



<p>When Hoover returned to the
United States after the war and
a long stay abroad, he came armed with a suggested
&ldquo;Reconstruction Program.&rdquo; Such programs are
familiar to the present generation, but they were new to the United
States in that more innocent
age. Like all such programs, it was heavy on government planning,
which was envisaged as &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; cooperative
action under &ldquo;central direction.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-3">3</a></sup>
The government was supposed to correct &ldquo;our
marginal faults&rdquo;&mdash;including undeveloped health and
education,
industrial &ldquo;waste,&rdquo; the failure to conserve
resources, the nasty habit
of resisting unionization, and seasonal unemployment. Featured in
Hoover&rsquo;s plan were increased inheritance taxes, public dams,
and,
significantly, government regulation of the stock market to eliminate
&ldquo;vicious speculation.&rdquo; Here was an early display of
Hoover&rsquo;s
hostility toward the stock market, a hostility that was to form one
of the <i>leitmotifs</i> of his administration.<sup><a href="#Note-7-4">4</a></sup>
Hoover, who to his credit
has never pretended to be the stalwart of laissez-faire that most
people now consider him, notes that some denounced his program
as &ldquo;radical&rdquo;&mdash;as well they might have. </p>



<p>So
&ldquo;forward-looking&rdquo; was Hoover and his program that
Louis
Brandeis, Herbert Croly of the <i>New Republic</i>,
Colonel Edward M.
House, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and other prominent Democrats
for a while boomed Hoover for the presidency.<sup><a href="#Note-7-5">5</a></sup></p>



<p>Hoover continued to expound
interventionism in many areas
during 1920. Most relevant to our concerns was the conference on
labor&ndash;management relations that Hoover directed from 1919 to
1920, on appointment by President Wilson and in association with
Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson, a former official of the
United Mine Workers of America. The conference&mdash;which included
&ldquo;forward-looking&rdquo; industrialists like Julius
Rosenwald, Oscar Straus,
and Owen D. Young, labor leaders, and economists like Frank W.
Taussig&mdash;recommended wider collective bargaining, criticized
&ldquo;company unions,&rdquo; urged the abolition of child
labor, and called for
national old-age insurance, fewer working hours, &ldquo;better
housing,&rdquo;
health insurance, and government arbitration boards for labor disputes.
These recommendations reflected Hoover&rsquo;s views.<sup><a href="#Note-7-6">6</a></sup></p>



<p>Hoover was appointed Secretary of
Commerce by President
Harding in March, 1921, under pressure from the left wing of the
Republican Party, led by William Allen White and Judge Nathan
Miller of New York. (Hoover was one of the first of the modern
breed of politician, who can find a home in either party.) We
have seen that the government pursued a largely laissez-faire
policy in the depression of 1920&ndash;1921, but this was not the
doing
of Herbert Hoover. On the contrary, he &ldquo;set out to
reconstruct
America.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-7">7</a></sup> He only accepted the
appointment on the condition
that he would be consulted on all economic policies of the federal
government. He was determined to transform the Department of
Commerce into &ldquo;the economic interpreter to the American
people
(and they badly need one).&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-8">8</a></sup> Hardly
had Hoover assumed office
when he began to organize an economic conference and a committee on
unemployment. The committee established a branch in
every state having substantial unemployment, along with subbranches in
local communities and Mayors&rsquo; Emergency Committees in 31
cities.<sup><a href="#Note-7-9">9</a></sup> The committee contributed relief to the
unemployed, and also organized collaboration between the local and
federal governments. </p>

<p>As Hoover recalls:
<blockquote>We developed cooperation between
the federal, state,
and municipal governments to increase public works.
We persuaded employers to &ldquo;divide&rdquo; time among their
employees so that as many as possible would have some
incomes. We organized the industries to undertake renovation, repair,
and, where possible, expand construction.<sup><a href="#Note-7-10">10</a></sup></blockquote>



Standard Oil of New Jersey
announced a policy of laying off its
older employees last, and it increased its repairs and production for
inventory; U.S. Steel also invested $10 million in repairs immediately
upon conclusion of the conference.<sup><a href="#Note-7-11">11</a></sup> In short,
the biggest
businesses were the first to agree. </p>



<p>Happily, the depression was about
over by the time these measures could take effect, but an ominous
shadow had been cast over
any future depression, a shadow that would grimly materialize
when the 1929 crash arrived. Once again, these measures bore the
characteristic Hoover stamp; the government compulsion and
planning were larded with the rhetoric of &ldquo;voluntary
cooperation.&rdquo;
He spoke of these and other suggested measures as
&ldquo;mobilization
of cooperative action of our manufacturers and employers, of our
public bodies and local authorities.&rdquo; And there came into use
the
now all too familiar war analogy: &ldquo;An infinite amount of
misery
could be saved if we have the same spirit of spontaneous cooperation in
every community for reconstruction that we had in war.&rdquo; </p>



<p>While the government did not
greatly intervene in the
1920&ndash;1921 recession, there were enough ominous seeds of the
later New Deal. In December, 1920, the War Finance Corporation
was revived as an aid to farm exports, and a $100 million Foreign
Trade Financial Corporation was established. Farm agitation
against short-selling led to the Capper Grain Futures Act, in
August, 1921, regulating trading on the grain exchanges. Furthermore,
on the state level, New York passed rent laws, restricting the
eviction rights of landlords; Kansas created an Industrial Court
regulating all key industries as &ldquo;public
utilities&rdquo;; and the Non-Partisan League conducted socialistic
experiments in North Dakota.<sup><a href="#Note-7-12">12</a></sup></p>



<p>Perhaps the most important
development of all, however, was
the President&rsquo;s Conference on Unemployment, called by Harding
at the instigation of the indefatigable Herbert Hoover. This was
probably the most fateful omen of anti-depression policies to
come. About 300 eminent men in industry, banking, and labor
were called together in September, 1921, to discuss the problem of
unemployment. President Harding&rsquo;s address to the conference
was
filled with great good sense and was almost the swan song of the
Old Order&rsquo;s way of dealing with depressions. Harding declared
that liquidation was inevitable and attacked governmental planning and
any suggestion of Treasury relief. He said, &ldquo;The excess
stimulation from that source is to be reckoned a cause of trouble
rather than a source of cure.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-13">13</a></sup></p>



<p>To the conference members, it was
clear that Harding&rsquo;s words
were mere stumbling blocks to the wheels of progress, and they
were quickly disregarded. The conferees obviously preferred
Hoover&rsquo;s opening speech, to the effect that the era of
passivity was
now over; in contrast to previous depressions, Hoover was convinced,
the government must &ldquo;do something.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-14">14</a></sup>
The conference&rsquo;s
aim was to promulgate the idea that government should be responsible
for curing depressions, even if the sponsors had no clear idea
of the specific things that government should do. The important
steps, in the view of the dominant leaders, were to urge the necessity
of government planning to combat depressions and to bolster
the idea of public works as a depression remedy.<sup><a href="#Note-7-15">15</a></sup>
The conference
very strongly and repeatedly praised the expansion of public works
in a depression and urged coordinated plans by all levels of government.<sup><a href="#Note-7-16">16
</a></sup>Not to be outdone by the new administration, former
President Wilson, in December, added his call for a federal public
works stabilization program. </p>



<p>The extreme public works
agitators were disappointed that the
conference did not go far enough. For example, the economist
William Leiserson had thought that a Federal Labor Reserve
Board &ldquo;would do for the labor market what the Federal Reserve
Board did for the banking interests.&rdquo; But the wiser heads saw
that
they had made a great gain. As a direct result of Hoover&rsquo;s
conference, twice as many municipal bonds for public works were floated
in 1921 and 1922 as in any previous year; Federal highway grantsin-aid
to the states totaled $75 million in the autumn of 1921, and
American opinion was aroused on the entire subject. </p>



<p>It was no accident that the
conference had arrived at its interventionist conclusions. As usually
happens in conferences of this
type, a small group of staff men, along with Herbert Hoover, actually
prepared the recommendations that the illustrious front men
duly ratified.<sup><a href="#Note-7-17">17</a></sup> Secretary of the crucial Public
Works Committee of
the Conference was Otto Tod Mallery, for a long time the
nation&rsquo;s
leading advocate of public works programs in depressions. Mallery
was a member and guiding spirit of the Pennsylvania State Industrial
Board and Secretary of the Pennsylvania Emergency Public
Works Commission, which had pioneered in public works planning, and
Mallery&rsquo;s resolutions thoughtfully pointed to the examples of
Pennsylvania and California as beacon lights for the Federal government
to follow.<sup><a href="#Note-7-18">18</a></sup> Mallery was one of the leading
spirits
in the American Association for Labor Legislation (AALL) an
organization of eminent citizens and economists devoted to the
promotion of government intervention in the fields of labor,
unemployment, and welfare. The Association had held the first
national unemployment conference in early 1914. Now, its executive
director, John B. Andrews, boasted that the Presidential
Conference&rsquo;s recommendations followed the standard
recommendations formulated by the AALL in 1915. These standard
recommendations featured public works and emergency public relief, <i>at
the usual hours and wage rates</i>&mdash;the wage rates of
the boom period
were supposed to be maintained.<sup><a href="#Note-7-19">19</a></sup> Neither was
the Conference&rsquo;s
following of the AALL line a coincidence. Aside from
Mallery&rsquo;s
critical role, the Conference also employed the expert knowledge
of the following economists, <i>all of whom were officials of
the AALL</i>:
John B. Andrews, Henry S. Dennison, Edwin F. Gay, Samuel A.
Lewisohn, Samuel McCune Lindsay, Wesley C. Mitchell, Ida M.
Tarbell, Mary Van Kleeck, and Leo Wolman.<sup><a href="#Note-7-20">20</a></sup></p>



<p>It seems clear that the
businessmen at the conference were not
supposed to mold policy; their function was to be indoctrinated
with the Hoover&ndash;AALL line and then to spread the
interventionist gospel to other business leaders. Andrews singled out
for particular praise in this regard Joseph H. Defrees, of the United
States
Chamber of Commerce, who appealed to many business organizations to
cooperate with the Mayors&rsquo; Emergency Committees, and
generally to accept &ldquo;business responsibility&rdquo; to
solve the unemployment problem. President Samuel Gompers of the
American
Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.) also hailed the widespread acceptance
by industry of its &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; for
unemployment, as an
outcome of this Conference. </p>



<p>Hoover did his best to intervene
in the recession, attempting
also to stimulate home construction and urging banks to finance
more exports. Fortunately, however, Harding and the rest of the
Cabinet were not convinced of the virtues of governmental depression
&ldquo;remedies.&rdquo; But eight years later, Hoover was
finally to have
his chance. As Lyons concludes: &ldquo;A precedent for federal
intervention in economic depression was set, rather to the horror of
conservatives.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-21">21</a></sup></p>



<p>It is, of course, a sociological
law that a government bureau,
once launched, never dies, and the Conference was true to this law.
The Conference resolved itself into three research committees,
run by a staff of experts, with Hoover in overall command. One
project bore fruit in Leo Wolman&rsquo;s <i>Planning and
Control of Public
Works</i>, a pro-public-works study published in 1930. A second
committee published a study on <i>Seasonal Operation in the
Construction
Industry</i>, in 1924, in cooperation with the Division of
Building and
Housing of the Department of Commerce. This work urged seasonal
stabilization of construction, and was in part the result of a
period of propaganda activity by the American Construction Council, a
trade association headed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Its
foreword was written by Herbert Hoover.<sup><a href="#Note-7-22">22</a></sup> The
most important
project was a study of <i>Business Cycles and Unemployment</i>,
published
in 1923. </p>



<p>Hoover invited the National
Bureau of Economic Research
(headed by Wesley C. Mitchell) to make a
&ldquo;fact-finding&rdquo; study of
the problems of forecasting and control of business cycles, and
then appointed a Committee on Business Cycles to draft policy
recommendations for the report. Chairman of the Committee was
Owen D. Young, and other members included Edward Eyre Hunt,
who had been secretary of the President&rsquo;s Conference, Joseph
Defrees, Mary Van Kleeck, Clarence Woolley, and Matthew Woll
of the A.F. of L. Funds for the project were considerately supplied
by the Carnegie Corporation. Wesley C. Mitchell, of the National
Bureau and AALL, planned and directed the report, which
included interventionist chapters by Mallery and Andrews on public
works and unemployment benefits, and by Wolman on unemployment
insurance. While the National Bureau was supposed to
do only fact-finding, Mitchell, in discussing his report, advocated
&ldquo;social experimentation.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-23">23</a></sup></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Hoover had not been
idle on the more direct legislative front. Senator W.S. Kenyon of Iowa,
in late 1921, introduced a bill supported by Hoover, embodying
recommendations
of the Conference and specifically requiring a public works
stabilization program. In the December, 1921 hearings, the Kenyon
Bill was supported by numerous leading economists, as well as by
the American Federation of Labor, the American Engineering
Council (of which Hoover had just been named President), and the
United States Chamber of Commerce. One of the supporters was
Wesley C. Mitchell. The bill never came to a vote, however,
largely due to healthy senatorial skepticism based on laissez-faire
ideas. </p>



<p>The next public works
stabilization bill before Congress was
the Zihlman Bill in the House. This was promoted by the National
Unemployment League, formed in 1922 for that purpose. Hearings were
held in the House Labor Committee in February, 1923.
Hoover backed the proposal, but it failed of adoption. </p>



<p>Finally, Hoover presented the
report on Business Cycles and
Unemployment to the Congress, and strongly urged a public
works program in depressions. Later, in 1929, Hoover&rsquo;s
Committee on Recent Economic Changes would also support a public
works program. </p>



<p>In 1924, the AALL continued its
agitation. It participated in a
national conference proposing public works planning. The conference was
called by the Federated American Engineering Societies
in January. In 1923, Wisconsin and Massachusetts were persuaded
to adopt a stabilizing public works program. Massachusetts was
directly swayed by testimony from the ubiquitous Andrews and
Mallery. These state programs were never translated into effective
action, but they did indicate the developing climate. In January,
1925, Hoover had the satisfaction of seeing President Coolidge
adopt his position. Addressing the Associated General Contractors
of America (a group that stood to gain by a government building
program), Coolidge called for public works planning to stabilize
depressions. Senators George H. Pepper and James Couzens tried
to pass public works planning legislation in 1925 and 1926, but
they failed, along with later attempts by Senator Wesley Jones,
who submitted bills that had been drafted in Hoover&rsquo;s
Department
of Commerce. The Republican Senate was the most recalcitrant,
and one Pepper Bill was filibustered to death there. Even favorable
reports by its Commerce Committee could not sway the Senate. By
this time, not only Hoover and Coolidge, but also Secretary Mellon,
the Democratic Party in 1924, and later Governor Alfred E. Smith
of New York, had endorsed the public works program. In May, 1928,
Senator Robert F. Wagner (D., N.Y.) introduced three bills for
comprehensive public works planning, including the creation of an
employment stabilization board, but the plan was not considered
by Congress.<sup><a href="#Note-7-24">24</a></sup></p>



<p>After Hoover was elected
President, he became more circumspect in presenting his views, but he
carried on the fight with
renewed vigor. His technique was to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Hoover Plan&rdquo; to
trusted associates, who would obviously be presenting
Hoover&rsquo;s
views. He chose as his vehicle Governor Ralph Owen Brewster of
Maine. Brewster presented a public works plan to the Conference of
Governors in late 1928, and waxed eloquent about the plan as
designed to &ldquo;prevent depressions.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-25">25</a></sup>
His use of the term &ldquo;Road to
Plenty&rdquo; was hardly a coincidence, for Hoover had adopted the
plan
of Messrs. Foster and Catchings, which had recently been outlined
in their famous book, <i>The Road to Plenty </i>(1928).
The authors had
submitted the plan to Brewster, and, after Hoover&rsquo;s
endorsement,
Brewster brought Professor William T. Foster along to the
Governors&rsquo; Conference as his technical advisor. Foster and
Catchings,
bellwethers of inflation and the bull market and leading
underconsumptionists, had been closely involved in the public works
agitation. Foster was director of the Pollak Foundation for Economic
Research, founded by investment banker Waddill Catchings. The
pair had published a series of very popular books during the 1920s,
agitating for such panaceas as public works and monetary inflation.<sup><a href="#Note-7-26">26</a></sup></p>



<p>Although seven or eight governors
were enthusiastic about the
Hoover&ndash;Foster&ndash;Catchings Plan, the Conference tabled
the idea. A
large part of the press hailed the plan in extravagant terms, as
&ldquo;prosperity insurance,&rdquo; a &ldquo;prosperity
reserve,&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;pact to outlaw
depression&rdquo;; while more conservative organs properly
ridiculed it as a chimerical and socialistic effort to outlaw the law
of supply and demand. It was not surprising that William Green of
the A.F of L. hailed the plan as the most important announcement on
wages and employment in a decade, or that the A.F. of L.&rsquo;s
John P
Frey announced that Hoover had now accepted the old A.F. of L.
theory that depressions are caused by underconsumption and low
wages.<sup><a href="#Note-7-27">27</a></sup>  The press reported that
&ldquo;labor is jubilant, because leaders
believe that the next President has found . . . a remedy for
unemployment which, at least in its philosophy and its groundwork, is
identical with that of labor.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-28">28</a></sup></p>



<p>The closeness of Foster and
Catchings to Hoover is again
demonstrated by the detailed account of their own Plan that they
published in April, 1929. In an article entitled &ldquo;Mr.
Hoover&rsquo;s Plan:
What It Is and What It Is Not&mdash;A New Attack on
Poverty,&rdquo; they
wrote authoritatively that Hoover should wield a stabilization public
works reserve, not of $150 million, as had often been mentioned
in previous years, but of the gigantic sum of $3 billion. This Plan
would iron out prices and the business cycle, and stabilize business.
At last, scientific economics was to be wielded as a weapon by an
American President: &ldquo;The Plan . . . is business guided by
measurements instead of hunches. It is economics for an age of
science&mdash;
economics worthy of the new President.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-29">29</a></sup></p>



<h3><center>THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOOVER&rsquo;S
INTERVENTIONISM: LABOR RELATIONS</center></h3>

<p>We cannot fully understand
Hoover&rsquo;s disastrous interference in
the labor market during the depression without tracing the development
of his views and actions on the labor front during the
1920s. We have seen that his Reconstruction Program and his
Economic Conference of 1920 praised collective bargaining and
unionism. In 1920, Hoover arranged a meeting of leading industrialists
with &ldquo;advanced views&rdquo; on labor relations to try
(unsuccessfully)
to persuade them to &ldquo;establish liaison&rdquo; with the
American Federation of Labor.<sup><a href="#Note-7-30">30</a></sup> From 1919
through 1923, Hoover tried to persuade private corporations to insure
the uninsurable by adopting
unemployment insurance, and in 1925 he praised the American
Federation of Labor as having &ldquo;exercised a powerful influence
in
stabilizing industry.&rdquo; He also favored the compulsory
unemployment of a child labor amendment, which would have lowered the
national product, and raised labor costs as well as the wages of
competing adult workers. Most important of Hoover&rsquo;s
activities in
the labor field was his successful war against United States Steel
and its chairman, Judge Elbert H. Gary, a war conducted as a
&ldquo;skillful publicity campaign&rdquo; (in the words of a
Hoover admirer)
against &ldquo;barbaric&rdquo; hours of work in the steel
industry.<sup><a href="#Note-7-31">31</a></sup> The success of this battle made it
much easier later on to persuade business
men to go along with his labor policies during the 1929 depression.
Hoover had decided that the twelve-hour day in the steel
industry must be eradicated and replaced by the eight-hour day.
He persuaded Harding, lapsing from his usual laissez-faire
instincts, to hold a conference of steel manufacturers in May, 1922,
at which Harding and Hoover called on the magnates to eliminate
the 12-hour day. An admiring biographer notes with satisfaction
that Hoover made the steel leaders &ldquo;squirm.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-32">32</a></sup>
It was of course
easy for Harding and Hoover, far removed from the necessity of
meeting a payroll or organizing production, to tell other people
how long and under what conditions they should work. Hoover
was supported by such &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; steelmen as
Alexander Legge
and Charles R. Hook, but bitterly opposed by other leaders like
Charles M. Schwab, and of course by Judge Gary, chairman of the
board of U.S. Steel and President of the American Iron and Steel
Institute. The war was on. </p>



<p>The steel agitation, it should be
pointed out, had not been
begun by Hoover. It originated back in September, 1919, when
Gary refused to engage in collective bargaining with a
workers&rsquo;
union. The workers struck on that issue, and the strike was led by
Communist leader William Z. Foster. By the time the strike had
failed, in January, 1920, public opinion, properly regarding the
strike as Bolshevik-inspired, was squarely on the side of U.S. Steel.
By this time, however, the Interchurch World Movement had
appointed a Commission of Inquiry into the strike; the Commission
issued a report favorable to the strikers in July, 1920, and
thereby initiated the eight-hour day agitation.<sup><a href="#Note-7-33">33</a></sup>
The report started
a propaganda war, with the nation&rsquo;s leftists attempting to
change
the whole temper of public opinion. The Reverend A.J. Muste, the
<i>Socialist New York Call</i>, <i>Labor</i>,
and <i>The Nation</i> backed the report,
while business associations strongly attacked the inquiry. The latter
included the National Association of Manufacturers, the
National Civic Federation, the<i> Wall Street Journal</i>,
and others.
Many religious papers, however, were persuaded by the prestige of
the committee (a prestige in religion that somehow carried over to
secular matters) to change their previous views and to line up on
the anti-steel side. </p>



<p>It was at this critical point in
the battle that Hoover entered the
fray and persuaded President Harding to join him. Hoover
&ldquo;deliberately broke the story&rdquo; of the unsuccessful
private meeting with
Gary, Schwab, and the others to the press. He told the press that
President Harding was &ldquo;attempting to persuade industry to
adopt
a reasonable working day.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-34">34</a></sup> Thus did
the government mobilize
public opinion on the side of the union. Hoover managed to have
the national Engineering Societies&mdash;effectively dominated by
Hoover&mdash;issue a report (again outside of their competence)
endorsing the eight-hour day in November, 1922. Hoover eulogized the
report, wrote the introduction, and persuaded Harding to sign it. Under
the Presidential pressure, Judge Gary appointed a committee of the
steel industry, headed by himself, to study the question. The committee
reported on May 25, 1923, unanimously
rejecting the eight-hour day demands. U.S. Steel also issued a
reply to the <i>Interchurch Report</i>, written by Mr.
Marshall Olds, and
endorsed by the prominent economist, Professor Jeremiah W.
Jenks. Abuse rained down on the steel industry from all sides.
Forgotten were the arguments used by U.S. Steel, e.g., that the steel
workers preferred the longer twelve-hour day because of the
increased income, and that production would suffer under an
eight-hour schedule.<sup><a href="#Note-7-35">35</a></sup></p>



<p>This and other arguments were
swept away by the wave of
emotionalism whipped up over the issue. The forces of the Social
Gospel hurled anathemas. &ldquo;Social Justice&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Social Action&rdquo;
committees of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish organizations set
up a clamor on issues about which they knew virtually nothing.
Attaching a quantitative codicil to the qualitative moral codes of
the Bible, they did not hesitate to declare that the twelve-hour day
was &ldquo;morally indefensible.&rdquo; They did not elaborate
whether it had
<i>suddenly</i> become &ldquo;morally
indefensible&rdquo; or whether it, and even
longer work days, had also been morally wicked throughout earlier
centuries. If the latter, it was certainly strange that countless
preceding generations of churchmen had overlooked the alleged sin;
if the former, then a curious historical relativism was now being
mingled with the presumably eternal truths of the Bible. </p>



<p>The American Association for
Labor Legislation of course
entered the fray, and threatened Federal maximum-hour legislation if
the steel industry did not succumb to its imperious
demands. But the most effective blow was a stern public letter of
rebuke sent to Gary by President Harding on June 18, written for
the President by Hoover. Faced by Harding&rsquo;s public requests
and
demands, Gary finally surrendered in July, permitting Hoover to
write the notice of triumph into Harding&rsquo;s Independence Day
address. </p>



<p>The Hoover&ndash;Harding
victory over U.S. Steel effectively tamed
industry, which, faced by this lesson, no longer had the fight to
withstand a potent combination of public and governmental pressures.<sup><a href="#Note-7-36">36</a></sup></p>



<p>Nor did this exhaust
Hoover&rsquo;s labor interventionism during the
1920s. Hoover played a major role in fostering railway unions, and
in foisting upon the railroad industry the Railway Labor Act&mdash;
America&rsquo;s first permanent incursion of the Federal government
into labor&ndash;management relations. The railroad problem had
begun in World War I, when the Federal government seized control of the
nation&rsquo;s rails. Run by Secretary of the Treasury
McAdoo, the government&rsquo;s policy was to encourage
unionization.
After the war was over, the railway unions tried their best to
perpetuate this bastion of socialism, and advocated the Plumb Plan,
which called for joint operation of the railroads by employers,
unions, and the government. </p>



<p>The railroads were returned to
private owners in 1920, but Congress gave a dangerous sop to the unions
by setting up a Railroad
Labor Board, with tripartite representation, to settle all labor
disputes. The Board&rsquo;s decisions did not have the force of
law, but they
could exert an undue pressure on public opinion. The unions were
happy with this arrangement, until the government representatives
saw the light of economic truth during the depression of 1921, and
recommended reductions in wage rates. The non-operating railway unions
conducted a nationwide strike in defiance of the proposed reduction in
the summer of 1922. While Attorney General
Daugherty acted ably in support of person and property by obtaining a
Federal injunction against union violence, the
&ldquo;horrified&rdquo;
Mr. Hoover, winning Secretary of State Hughes to his side, persuaded
Harding to force Daugherty to remove the injunction.
Hoover also intervened privately but insistently to try to wring
pro-union concessions from the railroads. </p>



<p>After the unions lost their
strike, they determined to rewrite the
law so that they could become established with the help of federal
coercion. From 1923 on, the unions fought for a compulsory arbitration
law. They achieved this goal with the Railway Labor Act of
1926, which, in effect, guaranteed collective bargaining to the railway
unions. The bill was drafted by union lawyers Donald Richberg and David
E. Lilienthal, and also by Herbert Hoover, who
originated the idea of the Railway Labor Mediation Board. Seeing
the growing support for such a law and lured by the promised
elimination of strikes, the bulk of the railroad industry surrendered
and went along with the bill. The Railway Labor Act&mdash;the first
giant step toward the collectivization of labor relations&mdash;was
opposed by only a few far-sighted railroads, and by the National
Association of Manufacturers.<sup><a href="#Note-7-37">37</a></sup></p>



<p>Even more mischievous than
Hoover&rsquo;s pro-union attitude was
his adoption of the new theory that high wage rates are an important
cause of prosperity. The notion grew during the 1920s that
America was more prosperous than other countries <i>because</i>
her
employers generously paid higher wage rates, thus insuring that
workers had the requisite purchasing power to buy industry&rsquo;s
products. While high real wage rates are actually the <i>consequence</i>
of
greater productivity and capital investment, this theory put the
cart before the horse by claiming that high wage rates were the
<i>cause</i> of high productivity and living standards. It
followed, of
course, that wage rates should be maintained, or even raised, to
stave off any threatening depression. Hoover began championing
this theory during the Unemployment Conference of 1921.</p>



<p>Employers on the manufacturing
committee wanted to urge lowering wage rates as a cure for
unemployment, but Hoover successfully insisted on killing this
recommendation.<sup><a href="#Note-7-38">38</a></sup> By the mid-1920s,
Hoover was trumpeting the &ldquo;new economics&rdquo; and
attacking the
&ldquo;old economics&rdquo; that resisted the new dispensation.
In a speech on
May 12, 1926, Secretary Hoover spread the gospel of high wage
rates that was to prove so disastrous a few years later: </p>



<p>not so many years
ago&mdash;the employer considered it was
in his interest to use the opportunities of unemployment
and immigration to lower wages irrespective of other
considerations. The lowest wages and longest hours
were then conceived as the means to obtain lowest production costs and
largest profits . . . . But we are a long
way on the road to new conceptions. The very essence
of great production is high wages and low prices,
because it depends upon a widening . . . consumption,
only to be obtained from the purchasing-power of high
real wages and increased standards of living.<sup><a href="#Note-7-39">39</a></sup></p>



<p>Hoover was not alone in
celebrating the &ldquo;new economics.&rdquo; The
National Industrial Conference Board reported that, while during
the 1920&ndash;1921 depression, wage rates fell by 19 percent in
one
year, the high wage theory had taken hold from then on. More and
more people adopted the theory that wage-cutting would dry up
purchasing-power and thus prolong the depression, while wage
rates held high would quickly cure business doldrums. This doctrine,
allied with the theory that high wage rates cause prosperity,
was preached by many industrialists, economists, and labor leaders
throughout the 1920s.<sup><a href="#Note-7-40">40</a></sup> The Conference Board
reported that
&ldquo;Much was heard of the dawn of a new era in which major
business
depressions could have no place.&rdquo; And Professor Leo Wolman
has
stated that the prevailing theory during the 1920s was that
&ldquo;high
and rising wages were necessary to a full flow of purchasing power
and, therefore, to good business.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-7-41">41</a></sup></p>



<p>As the final outgrowth of the
famous conference of 1921,
Hoover&rsquo;s Committee on Recent Economic Changes issued a
general multi-volume report on the American economy in 1929. Once
again, the basic investigations were made by the National Bureau.
The Committee did not at all foresee the great depression.
Instead, it hailed the price stability of the 1920s and the higher
wages. It celebrated the boom, little realizing that this was instead
its swan song: &ldquo;with rising wages and relatively stable
prices we
have become consumers of what we produce to an extent never
before realized.&rdquo; In the early postwar period, the Committee
opined, there were reactionary calls for the
&ldquo;liquidation&rdquo; of labor
back to prewar standards. But, soon, the &ldquo;leaders of
industrial
thought&rdquo; came to see that high wages sustained purchasing
power,
which in turn sustained prosperity. </p>



<p>They began consciously to
propound the principle of
high wages and low costs as a policy of enlightened
industrial practice. This principle has since attracted the
attention of economists all over the world&mdash;its application on
a broad scale is so novel.<sup><a href="#Note-7-42">42</a></sup></p>



<p>This change in the industrial
climate, according to the Committee, came about in a few short years,
largely due to the influence of the Conference on Unemployment. By the
fall of 1926,
steel magnate Eugene Grace was already heralding the new dispensation
in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>.<sup><a href="#Note-7-43">43</a></sup></p>



<p>The conclusions of the
Hoover-appointed economic committee were ominous in their own right.
&ldquo;To maintain the dynamic
equilibrium&rdquo; of the 1920s, it declared, leadership must be at
hand
to provide more and more &ldquo;deliberate public attention and
control.&rdquo; In fact, &ldquo;research and study, the orderly
classification of
knowledge . . . well may make complete control of the economic
system a possibility.&rdquo; To maintain the equilibrium,
&ldquo;We . . . (must)
develop a technique of balance,&rdquo; the technique to be supplied
by
economists, statisticians, and engineers, all &ldquo;working in
harmony
together.&rdquo; </p>



<p>And so, President Herbert Hoover,
on the eve of the Great
Depression, stood ready to meet any storm warnings on the business
horizon.<sup><a href="#Note-7-44">44</a></sup> Hoover, the &ldquo;Great
Engineer,&rdquo; stood now armed
on many fronts with the mighty weapons and blueprints of a
&ldquo;new
economic science.&rdquo; Unfettered by outworn laissez-faire
creeds, he
would use his &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; weapons boldly, if need
be, to bring the
business cycle under governmental control. As we shall see,
Hoover did not fail to employ promptly and vigorously his
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; political principles, or the new
&ldquo;tools&rdquo; provided him by
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; economists. And, as a direct consequence,
America was
brought to her knees as never before. Yet, by an ironic twist of fate,
the shambles that Hoover abandoned when he left office was
attributed, by Democratic critics, to his devotion to the outworn
tenets of laissez-faire.</p>
