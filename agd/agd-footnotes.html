	The depression of 1873&ndash;1879 was a special case. It was, in
	the first place, a
	mild recession, and second, it was largely a price decline generated by
	the monetary contraction attending return to the pre-Civil War gold
	standard. On the
	mildness of this depression, particularly in manufacturing, see O.V.
	Wells, &ldquo;The
	Depression of 1873&ndash;79,&rdquo; <i>Agricultural
	History </i>11 (1937): 240.</font></p></a>

	Even taken by itself, the &ldquo;contraction&rdquo; phase of
	the depression, from
	1929&ndash;1933, was unusually long and unusually severe,
	particularly in its degree of
	unemployment.</font></p></a>

	<a name="Note-0-4"><p><font size="-1"><sup>4</sup>This
	is by no means
	to deny that the ultimate
	premises of economic theory,
	e.g., the fundamental axiom of action, or the variety of resources, are
	derived

	priori</i> to all other historical facts. </font></p></a>

	This &ldquo;praxeological&rdquo; methodology runs counter to
	prevailing views.
	Exposition of this approach, along with references to the literature,
	may be found
	in Murray N. Rothbard, &ldquo;In Defense of &lsquo;Extreme <i>A

	Similarly, if the economy had recovered, the advocates would claim
	success
	for the theory, while critics would assert that recovery came <i>despite
	</i>the baleful
	influence of governmental policy, and more painfully and slowly than
	would otherwise have been the case. How should we decide between them?</font></p></a>

	The only really valuable studies of the 1929 depression are: Lionel
	Robbins,
	<i>The Great
	Depression </i>(New
	York: Macmillan, 1934),
	which deals with the United
	States only briefly; C.A. Phillips, T.F. McManus, and R.W. Nelson, <i>Banking
	and
	the Business Cycle </i>(New
	York: Macmillan, 1937); and Benjamin
	M. Anderson,
	<i>Economics and
	the Public Welfare </i>(New
	York: D. Van
	Nostrand, 1949), which does
	not deal solely with the depression, but covers twentieth-century
	economic history. Otherwise, Thomas Wilson&rsquo;s drastically
	overrated <i>Fluctuations
	in Income and
	Employment </i>(3rd
	ed., New York: Pitman, 1948) provides almost
	the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
	interpretation of the depression, and recently we have been confronted
	with John
	K. Galbraith&rsquo;s slick, superficial narrative of the pre-crash
	stock market, <i>The
	Great
	Crash, 1929 </i>(Boston:
	Houghton Mifflin, 1955). This, aside
	from very brief and
	unilluminating treatments by Slichter, Schumpeter, and Gordon is just
	about all.
	There are many tangential discussions, especially of the alleged
	&ldquo;mature economy&rdquo; of the later 1930s. Also see, on
	the depression and the Federal Reserve
	System, the recent brief article of O.K. Burrell, &ldquo;The Coming
	Crisis in External
	Convertibility in U.S. Gold,&rdquo; <i>Commercial
	and
	Financial Chronicle </i>(April
	23, 1959):

	&ldquo;Banks,&rdquo; for many purposes, include also savings
	and loan associations, and

	expansion to

	<p><font size="-1"> <a name="Note-1-8"><sup>8</sup>&ldquo;Inflation&rdquo;
	is here defined as an <i>increase in the money supply not
	consisting of an

	<p><font size="-1"><a name="Note-1-9"><sup>9</sup>
	This &ldquo;Austrian&rdquo; cycle theory settles the ancient
	economic controversy on
	whether or not changes in the quantity of money can affect the rate of
	interest. It
	supports the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; doctrine that an increase in
	the quantity of money lowers
	the rate of interest (if it first enters the loan market); on the other
	hand, it supports
	the classical view that, in the long run, quantity of money does not
	affect the interest rate (or can only do so if time preferences
	change). In fact, the depression-readjustment is the market&rsquo;s
	return to the desired free-market rate of interest.&nbsp;</a>
	</font></p>



	<font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-10"></a>10</sup>It
	is often
	maintained that since business firms can find few profitable
	opportunities in a depression, business demand for loans falls off, and
	hence loans and money
	supply will contract. But this argument
	overlooks
	the fact that the
	banks, if they want to, can purchase securities, and thereby sustain
	the money
	supply by increasing their investments to compensate for dwindling
	loans.
	Contractionist pressure therefore always stems from banks and not from
	business
	borrowers.

	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-11"></a>11</sup>
	Banks are &ldquo;inherently bankrupt&rdquo; because they issue
	far more warehouse
	receipts to cash (nowadays in the form of
	&ldquo;deposits&rdquo; redeemable in cash on
	demand) than they have cash available. Hence, they are always
	vulnerable to bank
	runs. These runs are not like any other business failures, because they
	simply consist of depositors claiming their own rightful property,
	which the banks do not
	have. &ldquo;Inherent bankruptcy,&rdquo; then, is an essential
	feature of any &ldquo;fractional
	reserve&rdquo; banking system. As Frank Graham stated: </font></p>



	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<p><font size="-1">The
	attempt of the banks to realize the inconsistent aims of
	lending cash,
	or merely multiplied claims to cash, and still to represent that cash
	is available on demand is even more preposterous than . . . eating
	one&rsquo;s cake and
	counting on it for future consumption. . . . The alleged convertibility
	is a
	delusion dependent upon the right&rsquo;s not being unduly
	exercised.</font></p>

	Proposal,&rdquo;

	<p><font size="-1"><a name="Note-1-12"><sup>12</sup>
	In a gold standard country (such as America during the 1929
	depression),
	Austrian economists accepted credit contraction as a perhaps necessary
	price to
	pay for remaining on gold. But few saw any remedial virtues in the
	deflation
	process itself. </a></font></p>



	<p><font size="-1"><a name="Note-1-13"><sup>13</sup></a>
	Some readers may ask: why doesn&rsquo;t credit contraction lead to
	malinvestment, by causing overinvestment in lower-order goods and
	underinvestment in
	higher-order goods, thus reversing the consequences of credit
	expansion? The
	answer stems from the Austrian analysis of the structure of production.
	There is
	no arbitrary choice of investing in lower or higher-order goods. Any
	increased
	investment <i>must</i> be made in the higher-order goods,
	must lengthen the structure
	of production. A decreased amount of investment in the economy simply
	reduces
	higher-order capital. Thus, credit contraction will cause <i>not</i>
	excess of investment in the lower
	orders, but simply a shorter
	structure than would otherwise have
	been established. </font></p>




	<font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-14">14</a></sup>In
	a gold standard economy, credit
	contraction
	is limited by the total size of
	the gold stock.

	In recent years, particularly in the literature on the
	&ldquo;under-developed countries,&rdquo; there has been a great
	deal of discussion of government &ldquo;investment.&rdquo;
	There can be no such investment, however.
	&ldquo;Investment&rdquo; is defined as expenditures made not
	for the direct satisfaction of those who make it, but for other,
	ultimate consumers. Machines are produced not to serve the
	entrepreneur, but to
	serve the ultimate consumers, who in turn remunerate the entrepreneurs.
	But
	government acquires its funds by seizing them from private individuals;
	the
	spending of the funds, therefore, gratifies the desires of <i>government
	officials.</i>
	Government officials have forcibly shifted production from satisfying
	private
	consumers to satisfying themselves; their spending is therefore pure
	consumption
	and can by no stretch of the term be called
	&ldquo;investment.&rdquo; (Of course, to the extent
	that government officials do not realize this, their
	&ldquo;consumption&rdquo; is really <i>waste</i>-
	spending.)&nbsp;

	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-18"></a>18</sup>
	I am indebted to Mr. Rae C. Heiple, II, for pointing this out to me. </font></p>



	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-19"></a>19</sup>Could
	government increase the
	investment&ndash;consumption ratio by <i> raising</i>
	taxes in any way? It could not tax <i>only</i> consumption
	even if it tried; it can be shown
	(and Prof. Harry Gunnison Brown has gone a long way to show) that any
	ostensible tax on &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; becomes, on the
	market, a tax on incomes, hurting
	saving as well as consumption. If we assume that the poor consume a
	greater proportion of their income than the rich, we might say that a
	tax on the poor used to
	subsidize the rich will raise the saving&ndash;consumption ratio
	and thereby help cure
	a depression. On the other hand, the poor do not necessarily have
	higher time
	preferences than the rich, and the rich might well treat government
	subsidies as
	special windfalls to be consumed. Furthermore, Harold Lubell has
	maintained
	that the effects of a <i>change </i>in income
	distribution on social consumption would be
	negligible, even though the absolute proportion of consumption is
	greater among
	the poor. See Harry Gunnison Brown, &ldquo;The Incidence of a
	General Output or a
	General Sales Tax,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Political Economy</i>(April,
	1939): 254&ndash;62; Harold

	Advocacy of any governmental policy must rest, in the final analysis,
	on a
	system of ethical principles. We do not attempt to discuss ethics in
	this book.
	Those who <i>wish </i>to prolong a depression, for
	whatever reason, will, of course,
	enthusiastically support these government interventions, as will those
	whose
	prime aim is the accretion of power in the hands of the state. </font></p>

	When gold&mdash;formerly the banks&rsquo; reserves&mdash;is
	transferred to a newly established Central Bank, the latter keeps only
	a fractional reserve, and thus the total
	credit base and potential monetary supply are enlarged. See C.A.
	Phillips, T.F.
	McManus, and R.W. Nelson,<i> Banking and the Business Cycle </i>(New
	York:
	Macmillan, 1937), pp. 24ff. </font></p>

	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-24"></a>24</sup>
	Many &ldquo;state banks&rdquo; were induced to join the FRS by
	patriotic appeals and
	offers of free services. Even the banks that did not join, however, are
	effectively
	controlled by the System, for, in order to obtain paper money, they
	must keep
	reserves in some member bank. </font></p>



	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-25"></a>25</sup>
	The average reserve requirements of all banks before 1913 was estimated
	at
	approximately 21 percent. By mid-1917, when the FRS had fully taken
	shape, the
	average required ratio was 10 percent. Phillips et al. estimate that
	the inherent
	inflationary impact of the FRS (pointed out in footnote 23) increased
	the expansive power of the banking system three-fold. Thus, the two
	factors (the inherent
	impact, and the deliberate lowering of reserve requirements) combined
	to inflate
	the monetary potential of the American banking system six-fold as a
	result of the
	inauguration of the FRS. See Phillips, et al.<i>, Banking and the
	Business Cycle, </i>pp. 23ff. </font></p>



	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-26"></a>26</sup>
	The horrors of &ldquo;wildcat banking&rdquo; in America before
	the Civil War stemmed
	from two factors, both due to government rather than free banking: (1)
	Since the
	beginnings of banking, in 1814 and then in every ensuing panic, state
	governments permitted banks to continue operating, making and calling
	loans, etc. without having to redeem in specie. In short, banks were
	privileged to operate without paying their obligations. (2)
	Prohibitions on interstate branch banking (which
	still exist), coupled with poor transportation, prevented banks from
	promptly calling on distant banks for redemption of notes. </font></p>



	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-27"></a>27</sup>
	Mises, <i>Human Action, </i>p. 440.&nbsp;</font></p>



	<p>
	<font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-28"></a>28</sup>A
	common analogy states that banks
	simply
	count on people not redeeming
	all their property at once, and that engineers who build bridges
	operate also on&nbsp;the principle that not everyone in a city will
	wish to cross
	the bridge at once. But
	the cases are entirely different. The people crossing a bridge are
	simply requesting a service; <i>they are not trying to take
	possession of their lawful property, </i>as are the
	bank depositors. A more fitting analogy would defend embezzlers who
	would
	never have been caught if someone hadn&rsquo;t fortuitously
	inspected the books. The
	crime comes when the theft or fraud is <i>committed</i>,
	not when it is finally revealed.</font></p>



	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-29"></a>29</sup>
	Perhaps a libertarian legal system would consider &ldquo;general
	deposit warrants&rdquo; (which allow a warehouse to return any
	homogeneous good to the depositor) as &ldquo;specific deposit
	warrants,&rdquo; which, like bills of lading, pawn tickets,
	dockwarrants, etc. establish ownership to specific, earmarked objects.
	As Jevons stated, &ldquo;It used to be held as a general rule of
	law, that any present grant or assignment of goods not in existence is
	without operation.&rdquo; See W. Stanley Jevons,
	<i>Money and the Mechanism of Exchange </i>(London: Kegan
	Paul, 1905), pp. 207&ndash;12.
	For an excellent discussion of the problems of a fractional-reserve
	money, see
	Amasa Walker, <i>The Science of Wealth </i>(3rd ed.,
	Boston: Little, Brown, 1867), pp.

	<p><font size="-1"><sup><a name="Note-1-30"></a>30</sup>
	Some writers make a great to-do over the legal fiction that the Federal
	Reserve System is &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by its member banks. In
	practice, this simply means
	that these banks are taxed to help pay for the support of the Federal
	Reserve. If
	the private banks really &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Fed, then how
	can its officials be appointed by
	the government, and the &ldquo;owners&rdquo; compelled to
	&ldquo;own&rdquo; the Federal Reserve
	Board by force of government statute? The Federal Reserve Banks should
	simply
	be regarded as governmental agencies. </font></p>

	also refutes the old notion that the

	capital.&rdquo; If that were true, then the crisis would reveal a
	shortage of circulating
	capital, and would greatly drive up the prices of, e.g., industrial raw
	materials. Yet,
	these materials are precisely among the ones revealed by the crisis to
	be overabundant, i.e., resources were malinvested in

	F.A. Hayek subjected J.M. Keynes&rsquo;s early&nbsp;<i>Treatise
	on Money</i> (now relatively
	forgotten amid the glow of his later&nbsp;<i>General Theory</i>)
	to a sound and searching critique, much of which applies to the later
	volume. Thus, Hayek pointed out that
	Keynes simply assumed that zero aggregate profit was just sufficient to
	maintain
	capital, whereas profits in the lower stages combined with equal losses
	in the
	higher stages would reduce the capital structure; Keynes ignored the
	various
	stages of production; ignored changes in capital value and neglected
	the identity
	between entrepreneurs and capitalists; took replacement of the capital
	structure
	for granted; neglected price differentials in the stages of production
	as the source
	of interest; and did not realize that, ultimately, the question faced
	by businessmen
	is not whether to invest in consumer goods or capital goods, but
	whether to invest
	in capital goods that will yield consumer goods at a {nearer
	or later} date. In general, Hayek found Keynes ignorant of
	capital theory and real-interest theory, particularly that of
	B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, a criticism borne out in Keynes&rsquo;s
	remarks on
	Mises&rsquo;s theory of interest. See John Maynard Keynes,&nbsp;<i>The

	Note that, in Figure 1, the S<sub>L</sub> S<sub>L</sub>
	line stops before reaching the horizontal
	axis. Actually, the line must stop at the wage yielding the minimum
	subsistence
	income. Below that wage rate, no one will work, and therefore, the
	supply curve
	of labor will really be horizontal, on the free market, at the minimum
	subsistence
	point. Certainly it will not be possible for speculative withholding to
	reduce wage
	rates to the subsistence level, for three reasons: (a) this speculative
	withholding
	almost always results in <i>hoarding</i>,
	which reduces
	prices all-round and which will
	therefore reduce the equilibrium money wage rate without reducing the
	equilibrium real wage rate&mdash;the relevant rate for the
	subsistence level, (b) entrepreneurs
	will realize that their speculation has overshot the mark long before
	the subsistence level is reached; and (c) this is especially true in an
	advanced capitalist economy, where the rates are far above subsistence.</p>



	<p><a name="Note-2-15"></a><sup>15</sup>
	On the other hand, wage rates maintained above the free-market level
	will
	discourage investment and thereby tend to increase hoarding at the
	expense of
	saving&ndash;investment. This decline in the
	investment&ndash;consumption ratio aggravates
	the depression further. Freely declining wage rates would permit
	investments to
	return to previous proportions, thus adding another important impetus
	to recovery. See Frederic Benham, <i>British
	Monetary Policy</i> (London:
	P.S. King and Son,
	1932), p. 77. </p>



	<p><a name="Note-2-16"></a><sup>16</sup>
	It has often been maintained that a failing price level injures
	business firms
	because it aggravates the burden of fixed monetary debt. However, the
	creditors
	of a firm are just as much its owners as are the equity shareholders.
	The equity
	shareholders have less equity in the business to the extent of its
	debts. Bond-holders (long-term creditors) are just different types of
	owners, very much as preferred and common stock holders exercise their
	ownership rights differently.
	Creditors save money and invest it in an enterprise, just as do
	stockholders.
	Therefore, no change in price level by itself helps or hampers a
	business; creditor&ndash;owners and debtor&ndash;owners may
	simply divide their gains (or losses) in different proportions. These
	are mere intra-owner controversies.</p>

		Anglo-American economics suffers badly from

	<p>In the present day, government savings bonds would have to be
	included in
	the money supply. On the other hand, pension funds are not part of the
	money
	supply, being simply saved and invested and not redeemable on demand,
	and neither are mutual funds&mdash;even the modern
	&ldquo;open-end&rdquo; variety of funds are
	redeemable not at par, but at market value of the stock. </p></a>



	<a name="note-4-8"><p><sup>8</sup>
	Data for savings-and-loan shares and life-insurance reserves are
	reliable only
	for the end-of-the-year: mid-year data are estimated by the author by
	interpolation. Strictly, the country&rsquo;s money supply is equal
	to the above data minus the
	amount of cash and demand deposits held by the savings and loan and
	life insurance companies. The latter figures are not available, but

	As McKinley says: <br/>

	<blockquote>Just as the ultimate source of reserve for commercial banks
	consists of the deposit liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks,
	so the ultimate source of the reserves of non-bank institutions
	consist of the deposit liabilities of the commercial banks. The
	money supply
	[is] . . . two inverted pyramids one on top of
	the
	other. The Federal Reserve stands at the base of the lower
	pyramid, and . . . by controlling the volume of their own
	deposit liabilities, the FRBs influence not only the deposit
	liabilities of the commercial banks but also the deposit liabilities
	of all those institutions which use the deposit liabilities of the
	commercial banks as cash reserves. </blockquote></p></a>

	It might be asked, despairingly: if the supposedly
	&ldquo;savings&rdquo; institutions (savings banks, insurance
	companies, saving and loan associations, etc.) are to be subject to a
	100 percent requirement, what savings would a libertarian society
	permit? The answer is: genuine savings, e.g., the issue of shares in an
	investing firm,
	or the sale of bonds or other debentures or term notes to savers, which
	would fall
	due at a certain date in the future. These genuinely saved funds would
	in turn be
	invested in business enterprise. </p></a>

	The War Finance Corporation had been dominant until 1921, when
	Congress expanded its authorized lending power and reorganized it to
	grant capital loans to farm cooperatives. In addition, the Federal Land
	Bank system, set up
	in 1916 to make mortgage loans to farm associations, resumed lending,
	and more
	Treasury funds for capital were authorized. And finally, the farm bloc
	pushed
	through the Agricultural Credits Act of 1923, which established twelve
	governmental Federal Intermediate Credit Banks to lend to farm
	associations. See
	Theodore Saloutos and John D. Hicks, <i>Agricultural Discontent

	<a name="link4"><p><sup>27</sup>Charles E. Mitchell, then head of the National

	for years for allegedly defying the FRB and
	frustrating the policy
	of moral suasion, by stepping in to lend to the stock market during the
	looming
	market crisis at the end of March. But it now appears that Mitchell and
	the other
	leading New York banks acted only upon approval of the Governor of the
	New

	which thus

	(Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1932), pp. 122&ndash;38.
	Dr. Lawrence E.
	Clark, a follower of H. Parker Willis, charged that Mr. Gates McGarrah,
	Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank at the time, opposed moral
	suasion because he himself was engaged in stock market
	speculation and in bank
	borrowing for that purpose. If this were the reason, however, McGarrah
	would
	hardly have been&mdash;as he was&mdash;the main force in urging
	an increase in the rediscount rate. Instead, he would have been against
	any check on the inflation. See
	Lawrence E. Clark, <i>Central Banking Under the Federal Reserve
	System </i>(New York:
	Macmillan, 1935), p. 267n. </p></a>



	<a name="link4"><p><sup>29</sup>
	The moral suasion policy was searchingly criticized by former FRB
	Chairman W.P.G. Harding. The policy continued on, however, probably at
	the
	insistence of Secretary of the Treasury Mellon, who strongly opposed
	any increase
	in the rediscount rate. See Anderson, <i>Economics and the

	Thus, on June 30, 1927, over 26 percent of the nation&rsquo;s total

	percent was held for its foreign accounts (foreign central banks).

	New York Fed and the House of Morgan were very close throughout this
	period.
	Strong had worked closely with the Morgan interests before assuming his
	post at
	the Federal Reserve. It is therefore significant that &ldquo;J.P.
	Morgan and Company
	have been the fiscal agents in this country of foreign governments and
	have had
	&lsquo;close working agreements&rsquo; with the Federal Reserve
	Bank of New York.&rdquo; Clark,

	Morgans were agents of the Bank of England. Also see Rist,
	&ldquo;Notice
	Biographique.&rdquo; To their credit, however, Morgans refused to
	go along with a
	Strong&ndash;Norman scheme to lend money to the Belgian government
	in order to
	prop up the Belgian exchange rate at an overvalued level, and thus
	subsidize inflationary Belgian policies.</a></p>
