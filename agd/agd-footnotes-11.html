similarly statist and inflationary measures of earlier Hoover years.

<p><font size="-1"><sup>23</sup>The defenders of the Glass&ndash;Steagall
Act might protest that the Act fitted
the quantitativist policy of considering <i>total quantity </i>rather
than quality of assets,
and therefore that an &ldquo;Austrian&rdquo; economist should
defend the measure. But the
point is that any further permission for government to lend to banks,
whether
quantitative or qualitative, is an inflationary addition to the
quantity of money,
and therefore to be criticized by the &ldquo;Austrian&rdquo;
economist. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><sup>25</sup>
To keep our perspective on the monetary contraction of the
1929&ndash;1932
period, which has often been pointed at with alarm, we should remember
that the
total money supply fell from $73.3 billion in June 1929, to $64.7
billion at the end
of 1932, a fall of only 11.6 percent, or 3.3 percent per annum. Compare
this rate
to the inflationary rise of 7.7 percent per annum during the boom of
the 1920s. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><sup>29</sup><i>New York Times </i>(January
16, 1933): 23. The barter movement had previously been tried
voluntarily on local levels, and had, of course, failed ignominiously,
a fact which almost always spurs ideologues to urge that the same
scheme
be imposed coercively by the federal government. The barter movement as
local
cooperative had begun with the Unemployed Citizens&rsquo; League of
Seattle in July,
1931, and soon spread to more than half the states. They all failed
quickly. Similar
local &ldquo;scrip exchanges&rdquo; failed rapidly, after each
issuance of the supposedly miraculous scrip. The most prominent scrip
exchange was the Emergency Exchange
Association of New York, flamboyantly organized by Stuart Chase and
other
intellectuals and professional men. See Dorfman, <i>The Economic

Speaking at the same conference, Professor John H. Williams admitted
that, for the 1920s: &ldquo;It can be argued that but for credit
expansion prices would
have fallen, and that they should have done so. It was on such grounds
that the
Austrian economists predicted the depression.&rdquo; John H.

Stabilization and the Gold Standard,&rdquo; in ibid.<i>, </i>p<i>.</i>

general statement either. </font></p>



<p><font size="-1"><sup>36</sup>
Another expression of sound money sentiment, though hardly as
penetrating as Haberler&rsquo;s, came later in the year, in
September. A group of economists
issued a statement, attacking inflation or any abandonment of the gold
standard,
calling for a balanced budget through lower taxes and expenditures
rather than
through higher taxes, attacking government propping up of unsound
corporate
positions which should liquidate quickly, and attacking the Hoover
experiments
in farm price supports. They pointed out that inflation&rsquo;s
benefits are only illusory and that it simply and disruptively benefits
one group at the expense of another, and therefore could not help cure
the depression. They also urged tariff reduction, and cutting the
salaries of government employees, whose pay had unfortunately remained
the same while the income of taxpayers had declined. Deviating
from soundness, however, were their proposals for a Federal system of
employment exchanges, hints of favoring unemployment insurance, and
acceptance of a
continuing RFC, relief programs, and temporary expedients to check
deflation.
