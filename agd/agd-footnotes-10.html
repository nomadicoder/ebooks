	The secret relations between Governor Norman and the head of the
	Federal
	Reserve Bank of New York continued during the depression. In August,
	1932,
	Norman landed at Boston, and traveled to New York under the alias of
	&ldquo;Professor
	Clarence Skinner.&rdquo; We do not know what transpired at this
	conference with
	Reserve Bank leaders, but the Bank of England congratulated Norman upon
	his
	return for having &ldquo;sowed a seed.&rdquo; See Lawrence E.

	Later, the Swope idea took form in the NRA, with Swope himself helping
	to write the final draft, and staying in Washington to help run it.
	Swope thus
	became perhaps the leading industrialist among the &ldquo;Brain
	Trust.&rdquo; Henry I.

	up as a

	If the coal industry was not as successful as the oil in becoming
	cartellized,
	it was not for lack of trying. C.E. Bockus, president of the National
	Coal
	Association, wrote in an article, &ldquo;The Menace of
	Overproduction,&rdquo; of the need of
	the coal industry 
	<blockquote>to secure, by cooperative action, the continuous adjustment of
	the production of bituminous coal to the existing demand for it,
	thereby discouraging wasteful methods of production and consumption. .
	. . The
	European method of meeting this situation is through the establishment
	of cartels. </blockquote>

	<p>Hoover also reduced production in other fields by adding over
	two million
	acres to the virtually useless national forests during his regime, as
	well as increasing the area of the totally useless national parks and
	monuments by forty percent.
	If Congress had not balked, he would have permanently sequestered much
	more
	usable land. See Harris Gaylord Warren, <i>Herbert Hoover and
