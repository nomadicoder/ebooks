	An apt commentary on whether time deposits are money is this statement
	by
	two St. Louis bankers: 



	<blockquote>Actually all of us were treating our savings and time deposits as demand<
	deposits and we still do . . . we still pay our savings depositors on
	demand.
	It is significant that the heavy runs on banks were engineered by
	savings
	and time depositors. When the trouble was at its height in January,
	1933,
	practically every bank in St. Louis faced heavy withdrawals from . . .
	savings depositors and had a minimum of diffculty with the checking
	depositors. This was true throughout most of the country. </blockquote></p>

	<font size="-1"><a name="Note-12-5"><p><sup>5</sup>Detroit had especially overexpanded during the
	boom, and frantic efforts by
	Hoover and his administration, along with Detroit industrialists and
	New York
	banks, to save the leading Detroit banks, had foundered on the devotion
	to private enterprise and true private responsibility of Henry Ford and
	of Michigan&rsquo;s
	Senator Couzens, both of whom refused to agree to subsidize unsound
	banking.
	See ibid.<i>, </i>pp. 58&ndash;65. Also see Lawrence
	E. Clark, <i>Central Banking Under the
	Federal Reserve System </i>(New York: Macmillan, 1935), pp.
	226ff.; Benjamin M.
	Anderson, <i>Economics and the Public Welfare </i>(New
	York: D. Van Nostrand, 1949),
	pp. 285ff. Dr. Anderson, supposedly an advocate of <i>laissez-faire,
	</i>sound money, and
	property right, went so far in the other direction as to chide the
	states for not
	going further in declaring bank holidays. He declared that bank
	moratoria should
	have applied to 100 percent, not just 95 percent, of bank deposits, and
	he also
	attacked the Clearing House for failing to issue large quantities of
	paper money
	during the crisis. </p></a></font>

	Banking,&rdquo; in Willis and John M.
	Chapman, eds., <i>The Banking Situation </i>(New York:
	Columbia University Press,
	1934), pp. 9ff. The holiday laws either (a) forbade banks to redeem the
	funds of
	depositors, or (b) permitted the banks to choose the proportion of
	claims that
	they would pay, or (c) designated the proportion of claims the
	depositors might
	redeem. </p></a></font>

	Ibid., p. 11. In New York, the pressure for bank closing came from the
	upstate, rather than from the Wall Street, banks. </p></a></font>



	<font size="-1"><a name="Note-12-8"><p><sup>8</sup>See ibid<i>. </i>Michigan&rsquo;s
	Governor Comstock, who had begun the furor, naturally extended his
	holiday beyond the original eight-day period. </p></a></font>



	<font size="-1"><a name="Note-12-9"><p><sup>9</sup>Lest it be thought that Hoover would never have
	contemplated going this
	far, Jesse Jones reports that Hoover, during the banking crisis, was
	seriously contemplating invoking a forgotten wartime law making
	hoarding a criminal offense!
	Ibid.<i>, </i>p. 18. </p></a></font>



	<font size="-1"><a name="Note-12-10"><p><sup>10</sup>
	There was a recurring tendency on the part of Hoover and his colleagues
	to
	blame the whole depression on a plot by Hoover&rsquo;s political
	enemies. </p>



	<p>Hoover attributed part of the currency crisis to Communists spreading
	distrust of the American monetary system (it is remarkable that
	Communists were
	needed for distrust to arise!); and Simeon D. Fess, Chairman of the
	Republican
	National Committee, said quite seriously in the fall of 1930: 



	<blockquote>Persons high in Republican circles are beginning to believe that there
	is
	some concerted effort on foot to utilize the stock market as a method of
	discrediting the administration. Every time an administration official
	gives out an optimistic statement about business conditions, the market
	immediately drops. </blockquote></p>

	<font size="-1"><a name="Note-12-11"><p><sup>11</sup>Another Hoover contribution to these times was
	a secret attempt to stop the
	press from printing the full truth about the banking crisis, and about
	views hostile to his administration. See Kent Cooper, <i>Kent
	Cooper and the Associated Press</i>
	(New York: Random House, 1959), p. 157. </p></a></font>

	proudly: &ldquo;the going off [gold] cannot be laid to Franklin
	Roosevelt. It had been determined to be necessary by

	Undersecretary, long
	before Franklin Roosevelt took office.&rdquo; <i>New York
