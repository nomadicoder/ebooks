<h3>1931&mdash;&ldquo;The Tragic Year&rdquo;</h3>


</div>



<p><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>he year 1931, which politicians
and economists were sure
would bring recovery, brought instead a far deeper crisis
and depression. Hence Dr. Benjamin Anderson&rsquo;s apt term
&ldquo;the tragic
year.&rdquo; Particularly dramatic was the financial and economic
crisis in Europe which struck in that year. Europe was hit
hard partly in reaction to its own previous inflation, partly from
inflation induced by our foreign loans and Federal Reserve
encouragement and aid, and partly from the high American tariffs
which prevented them from selling us goods to pay their debts. </p>



<p>The foreign crisis began in the
Boden&ndash;Kredit Anstalt, the most
important bank in Austria and indeed in Eastern Europe, which,
like its fellows, had overexpanded.<sup><a href="#Note-10-1">1</a></sup> It had
suffered serious financial
trouble in 1929, but various governmental and other sources had
leaped to its aid, driven by the blind expediency of the moment
telling them that such a large bank must not be permitted to fail.
In October, 1929, therefore, the crumbling
Boden&ndash;Kredit&ndash;Anstalt
merged with the older and stronger
Oesterreichische&ndash;Kredit&ndash;
Anstalt, with new capital provided by an international banking
syndicate including J.P. Morgan and Company, and Schroeder of
England, and headed by Rothschild of Vienna. The Austrian Government
also guaranteed some of the Boden bank&rsquo;s investment.
This shored up the shaky bank temporarily. The crisis came when
<!-- Page 257 -->
Austria turned to its natural
ally, Germany, and, in a world of
growing trade barriers and restrictions, declared a customs union
with Germany on March 21, 1931. The French Government
feared and hated this development, and hence the Bank of France
and lesser French banks suddenly insisted on redemption of their
short-term debts from Germany and Austria. </p>



<p>The destructive political motive
of the French government cannot be condoned, but the act itself was
fully justified. If Austria was
in debt to France, it was the Austrian debtors&rsquo;
responsibility to
have enough funds available to meet any liabilities that might be
claimed. The guilt for the collapse must therefore rest on the bank
itself and on the various governments and financiers who had tried
to shore it up, and had thus aggravated its unsound position. The
Kredit&ndash;Anstalt suffered a run in mid-May; and the Bank of
England, the Austrian Government, Rothschild, and the Bank of
International Settlements&mdash;aided by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New
York&mdash;again granted it many millions of dollars. None of this
was
sufficient. Finally, the Austrian Government, at the end of May,
voted a $150 million guarantee to the bank, but the Austrian
Government&rsquo;s credit was now worthless, and Austria soon
declared
national bankruptcy by going off the gold standard. </p>



<p>There is no need to dwell on the
international difficulties that
piled up in Europe in latter 1931, finally leading Germany, England,
and most other European countries to renounce their obligations and go
off the gold standard. The European collapse
affected the United States monetarily and financially (1) by causing
people to doubt the firmness of American adherence to the
gold standard, and (2) through tie-ins of American banks with their
collapsing European colleagues. Thus, American banks held
almost $2 billion worth of German bank acceptances, and the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York had participated in the unsuccessful shoring
operations. The fall in European imports from the
United States as a result of the depression was not the major cause
of the deeper depression here. American exports in 1929 constituted
less than 6 percent of American business, so that while American
agriculture was further depressed by international developments, the
great bulk of the American depression was caused by
strictly American problems and policies. Foreign governments
contributed a small share to the American crisis, but the bulk of
responsibility must be placed upon the American government itself.</p>



<p>Although we must confine our
interest in this work to the
United States, we may pause a moment, in view of its international
importance, and consider the shabby actions of Great Britain in
this crisis. Great Britain&mdash;the government that induced Europe
to
go onto the treacherous shoals of the gold bullion and goldexchange
standard during the 1920s, that induced the United
States government to inflate with disastrous consequences, that
induced Germany to inflate through foreign investment, that tried
to establish sterling as the world&rsquo;s premier
currency&mdash;surrendered
and went off the gold standard without a fight. Aided by France
instead of the reverse, much stronger financially than Germany or
Austria, England cynically repudiated its obligations without a
struggle, while Germany and Austria had at least fought frantically
to save themselves. England would not consider giving up its
inflationary and cheap credit policy, even to stay on sound money.
Throughout the crisis of 1931, the Bank of England kept its discount
rate very low, never going above 42 percent, and in fact,
inflated its deposits in order to offset gold losses abroad. In former
financial crises, the bank rate would have gone to 10 percent much
earlier in the proceedings, and the money supply would have been
contracted, not expanded. The bank accepted loans of $650 million from
the Federal Reserve Banks and the Bank of France; and
the Bank of France, forced against its better judgment by the
French Government, kept its accounts in sterling and did not ask
for redemption in gold. And then, on September 20, Britain went
coolly off the gold standard, inflicting great losses on France,
throwing the world into monetary chaos, and disrupting world
markets. It is a final measure of the character of Governor Montagu
Norman that only two days before the repudiation, he gave
Doctor Vissering, head of the Netherlands Bank, unqualified
assurance that Britain would remain on the gold standard and that
therefore it was safe for the Netherlands to keep its accounts in
sterling. If the Netherlands was tricked, it is possible that Montagu
Norman&rsquo;s fast friends in the United States were informed in
advance. For in the summer of 1931, Governor Norman visited
Quebec, for &ldquo;health&rdquo; reasons, and saw Governor
Harrison of the
New York Federal Reserve Bank. It was shortly after Norman&rsquo;s
return to England that Great Britain went off the gold standard.<sup><a href="#Note-10-2">2</a></sup></p>



<p>Throughout the European crisis,
the Federal Reserve, particularly the New York Bank, tried its best to
aid the European governments and to prop up unsound credit positions.
In mid-July, the
executive committee of the New York Bank had an all-day conference with
the leaders of J.P. Morgan and Company, and there
decided to follow the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; of the Bank of
International Settlements, the &ldquo;club&rdquo; of European
central banks. It therefore loaned
money to the Reichsbank to purchase German acceptances, and
made special loans to other Central Banks to relieve frozen assets
there. The New York Federal Reserve loaned, in 1931, $125 million to
the Bank of England, $25 million to the German Reichsbank, and smaller
amounts to Hungary and Austria. As a result,
much frozen assets were shifted, to become burdens to the United
States. The Federal Reserve also renewed foreign loans when borrowers
failed to pay at maturity.<sup><a href="#Note-10-3">3</a></sup></p>



<center><h3>THE AMERICAN MONETARY PICTURE</h3></center>

<p>In the meanwhile, the depression
grew ever worse in the
United States, and not because of the European situation. Production
continued to plummet drastically, as did prices and foreign trade,
and unemployment skyrocketed to almost 16 percent of the labor
force. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) index of manufacturing
production, which had been 110 in 1929 and 90 in 1930, fell to 75
in 1931. Hardest hit, in accordance with Austrian cycle theory,
were producers&rsquo; goods and higher order capital goods
industries,
rather than the consumer goods&rsquo; industries. Thus, from the
end of
1929 to the end of 1931, the FRB index of production of durable
manufactures fell by over 50 percent, while the index of nondurable
production fell by less than 20 percent. Pig iron production fell from
131 thousand tons per day (seasonally adjusted) in
June, 1929, to 56 thousand tons daily in December, 1930, to 33
thousand tons in December, 1931, a drop of nearly 80 percent. On
the other hand, retail department store sales only fell from an
index of 118 in 1929 to 88 at the end of 1931, a drop of about 25
percent. </p>



<p>The American monetary picture
remained about the same until
the latter half of 1931. At the end of 1930, currency and bank
deposits had been $53.6 billion; on June 30, 1931, they were
slightly lower, at $52.9 billion. By the end of the year, they had
fallen sharply to $48.3 billion. Over the entire year, the aggregate
money supply fell from $73.2 billion to $68.2 billion. The sharp
deflation occurred in the final quarter, as a result of the general
blow to confidence caused by Britain going off gold. From the
beginning of the year until the end of September, total member
bank reserves fell by $107 million. The Federal Government had
tried hard to inflate, raising <i>controlled</i> reserves
by $195 million&mdash;
largely in bills bought and bills discounted, but<i> uncontrolled</i>
reserves declined by $302 million, largely due to a huge $356 million
increase of money in circulation. Normally, money in circulation
declines in the first part of the year, and then increases around
Christmas time. The increase in the first part of this year reflected
a growing loss of confidence by Americans in their banking
system&mdash;caused by the bank failures abroad and the growing
number
of failures at home. Americans should have lost confidence ages
before, for the banking institutions were hardly worthy of their
trust. The inflationary attempts of the government from January
to October were thus offset by the people&rsquo;s attempts to
convert
their bank deposits into legal tender. From the end of September
to the end of the year, bank reserves fell at an unprecedented rate,
from $2.36 billion to $1.96 billion, a drop of $400 million in three
months. The Federal Reserve tried its best to continue its favorite
nostrum of inflation&mdash;pumping $268 million of new controlled
reserves into the banking system (the main item: an increase of
$305 million in bills discounted). But the public, at home and
abroad, was now calling the turn at last. From the beginning of the
depression until September, 1931, the monetary gold stock of the
country had increased from $4 billion to $4.7 billion, as European
monetary troubles induced people to send their gold to the United
States. But the British crisis made men doubt the credit of the dollar
for the first time, and hence by the end of December,
America&rsquo;s
monetary gold stock had fallen to $4.2 billion. The gold drain that
began in September, 1931, and was to continue until July, 1932,
reduced U.S. monetary gold stock from $4.7 billion to $3.6 billion.
This was a testament to the gold-exchange standard that Great
Britain had induced Europe to adopt in the 1920s.<sup><a href="#Note-10-4">4</a></sup>
Money in circulation also continued to increase sharply, in response to
public
fears about the banking structure as well as to regular seasonal
demands. Money in circulation therefore rose by $400 million in
these three months. Hence, the will of the public caused bank
reserves to decline by $400 million in the latter half of 1931, and
the money supply, as a consequence, fell by over four billion dollars
in the same period. </p>



<p>During 1930, the Federal Reserve
had steadily lowered its
rediscount rates: from 42 percent at the beginning of the year, to
2 percent at the end, and finally down to 12 percent in mid-1931.
When the monetary crisis came at the end of the year, the Federal
Reserve raised the rediscount rate to 32 percent. Acceptance buying
rates were similarly raised after a steady decline. The Federal
Reserve System (FRS) has been sharply criticized by economists
for its &ldquo;tight money&rdquo; policy in the last quarter of
1931. Actually, its
policy was still inflationary on balance, since it still increased
controlled reserves. And any greater degree of inflation would have
endangered the gold standard itself. Actually, the Federal Reserve
should have <i>deflated</i> instead of inflated, to
bolster confidence in
gold, and also to speed up the adjustments needed to end the
depression. </p>



<p>The inflationary policies of the
Federal Reserve were not
enough for some economists, however, including the price
stabilizationist and staunch ally of the late Governor Strong, Carl
Snyder, statistician at the New York Federal Reserve. As early as
April,
1931, Snyder organized a petition of economists to the Federal
Reserve Board urging immediate cheap money, as well as longrange credit
expansion. Among the signers were: John R. Commons, Lionel D. Edic,
Virgil Jordan, Harold L. Reed, James Harvey Rogers, Walter E. Spahr,
and George F. Warren.<sup><a href="#Note-10-5">5</a></sup></p>



<center><h3>THE FISCAL BURDEN OF GOVERNMENT</h3></center>

<p>How did the fiscal burden of
government press upon the public during 1931? The gross national
product fell from $91.1 billion
in 1930, to $76.3 billion in 1931. Gross private product fell from
$85.8 billion to $70.9 billion; total government depredations, on
the other hand, <i>rose</i> from $14.1 to $15.2 billion.
Total government
receipts fell from $13.5 billion to $12.4 billion (Federal receipts
fell from $4.4 to $3.4 billion), but total government expenditures
rose sharply, from $13.9 billion to $15.2 billion. This time, the
entire rise in expenditures came in federal, rather than state and
local, spending. Federal expenditures rose from $4.2 billion in
1930 to $5.5 billion in 1931&mdash;excluding government
enterprises, it
rose from $3.1 billion to $4.4 billion, an enormous 42 percent
increase. In short, in the midst of a great depression when people
needed desperately to be relieved of governmental burdens, the
dead weight of government rose from 16.4 percent to 21.5 percent
of the gross private product (from 18.2 percent to 24.3 percent of
the net private product). From a modest surplus in 1930, the Federal
government thus ran up a huge $2.2 billion deficit in 1931.
And so President Hoover, often considered to be a staunch exponent of
laissez-faire, had amassed by far the largest peacetime
deficit yet known to American history. In one year, the fiscal burden
of the Federal government had increased from 5.1 percent to
7.8 percent, or from 5.7 percent to 8.8 percent of the net private
product. </p>



<p>Of the $1.3 billion increase in
Federal expenditures in 1931, by
far the largest sum, $1 billion, was an increase in transfer payments.
New public construction also increased at the same pace as
the previous year, by over $60 million; grants-in-aid to state and
local governments rose by almost $200 million. Of the $1 billion
rise in transfer payments, $900 million was an increase in
&ldquo;adjusted
compensation benefits,&rdquo; largely loans to veterans. </p>



<center><h3>PUBLIC WORKS AND WAGE RATES</h3></center>

What of Hoover&rsquo;s cherished programs of public works planning
and maintenance of wage rates? We have noted that Hoover established an
Emergency Committee for Employment in October,
1930, headed by Colonel Arthur Woods. Woods was a trustee of
the Rockefeller Foundation and of Rockefeller&rsquo;s General
Education Board. Also on the committee were industrialists Sewell
Avery, William J. Bault of Metropolitan Life, the ever ubiquitous
Beardsley Ruml, and economists such as Professor Joseph H.
Willits, Leo Wolman, J. Douglas Brown, W. Jett Lauck, Lewis E.
Meriam, and Fred C. Croxton. The Committee strongly recommended
increased expenditures for public works at all levels of
government. The President&rsquo;s Committee was one of the major
forces supporting the Wagner Employment Stabilization Act of
February, 1931&mdash;its Public Works Section being especially
active.
And, in signing the bill, Hoover gave a large amount of the credit
for the measure to none other than Otto Tod Mallery.<sup><a href="#Note-10-6">6</a></sup>
The President&rsquo;s Committee was the main government organ
dealing with
employers and urging them to maintain wage rates. Writing
proudly of the Committee&rsquo;s work, one of its members later
praised
its success in inducing employers to refrain from those reductions
in wage rates &ldquo;which had marked similar periods&rdquo; of
depression.<sup><a href="#Note-10-7">7</a></sup>
It is, of course, not surprising that there were very few strikes in
this period. In March, Colonel Woods proudly hailed the &ldquo;new
view&rdquo; of industry&mdash;in accepting its
&ldquo;responsibility toward labor.&rdquo;

Industry, instead of cutting
wage rates, was now maintaining the
purchasing-power of the workers as a measure of &ldquo;enlightened
self-interest.&rdquo; The Committee persuaded ten outstanding
industrial and labor leaders to give public radio talks, explaining the
brave new philosophy. The Committee was also gratified to see
advances in public works construction during the year. The
Employment Stabilization Act of February merely served to whet,
rather than allay, the appetites of the public works agitators.<sup><a href="#Note-10-8">8</a></sup>
During the year, Senator Wagner suggested a $2 billion public works
program, and Senator LaFollette urged a gigantic $5.5 billion outlay.
At the end of the year 1931, 31 leading economists convened
in New York City at a conference sponsored by William Randolph
Hearst, and recommended a $5 billion public works program. It
was to be financed by a bond issue. The economists emphasized
that a rise in Federal public works outlay during 1931 had been
offset by a decline in state and local construction, so that overall
public construction was less than in the previous year. They urged
a bold program, accompanied by credit expansion, and conducted
in the good old spirit of a wartime emergency. Among the signers
of this document were Professors James C. Bonbright, Phillips
Bradley, Paul F. Brissenden, Thomas Nixon Carver, Paul H. Douglas, Seba
Eldridge, William Trufant Foster, Arthur D. Gayer,
John Ise, J.E. LeRossignol, W.N. Loucks, Robert M. Maclver,
George R. Taylor, Williard L. Thorp, and Norman J. Ware.<sup><a href="#Note-10-9">9</a></sup></p>



<p>We might mention here that at
the very time President Hoover
was sponsoring make-work schemes, he stepped in to hamper private
production in another field. In May, he ordered the cessation
of the leasing of Federal forests for new lumbering, thus withdrawing
forest land from production and aggravating the severe
depression in the lumber trade. </p>



<p>On the state level, Governor
Franklin D. Roosevelt of New
York pioneered in public works planning, setting up a Committee
on the Stabilization of Industry for the Prevention of Unemployment,
with Henry Bruere chairman and Paul H. Douglas, technical adviser. The
Committee recommended a state planning board
for public works, and work-sharing among workers. Roosevelt also
called a seven-state conference at the end of January, 1931, to urge
Federal and state public works: the chief adviser was Professor Leo
Wolman, and others were Professors William Leiserson and Paul H.
Douglas. The next few days saw a Conference on the Permanent
Prevention of Unemployment, convened by the social action
departments of the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish churches. At
this conference, Edward Eyre Hunt, of the President&rsquo;s
Emergency
Committee for Employment, called for public works; William T.
Foster urged an increase in the money supply, John P. Frey of the
A.F. of L. called for yet higher wages as a remedy for the depression,
George Soule urged socialist planning, Professor John R.
Commons and John Edgerton of the NAM quarreled over compulsory
unemployment insurance, and Senator Wagner boosted
his bill for public works and stabilization. </p>



<p>During early 1931, California
set up a State Unemployment
Committee to aid localities and stimulate public works, and
Pennsylvania presented a planned program of public works. Maryland
speeded its public works program, Massachusetts floated a bond
issue for public works, and Michigan continued highway construction
during the winter&mdash;normally a slack season. Michigan insisted
that contractors not cut the wage rates paid to their workers.
Minnesota went so far in a make-work policy on its public work programs
as to stipulate that &ldquo;wherever practical, and whenever the
cost is substantially the same, work should be performed by hand
rather than by machines in order to provide for the employment of
a greater number of persons.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-10">10</a></sup></p>



<center><h3>MAINTAINING WAGE RATES</h3></center>

<p>The maintenance of wage rates in
the face of steadily declining
prices (wholesale prices fell by 10 percent in 1930, by 15 percent
in 1931), meant that the <i> real</i> wage rates of the
employed were
sharply increasing, thereby greatly aggravating the unemployment
problem as time went on. Summing up the wage question at the
end of 1931, Professor Leo Wolman pointed out that business
leaders, as well as government, were still under the influence of the
prevailing doctrine of the 1920s: that &ldquo;high and rising wages
were
necessary to a full flow of purchasing power and, therefore, to
good business.&rdquo; During the depression, business leaders
typically
continued to say: &ldquo;reducing the income of labor is not a
remedy for
business depression, it is a direct and contributory cause&rdquo;;
or



<blockquote>in this enlightened age when it
is recognized that production is dependent upon consuming power,<sup><a href="#Note-10-11">11</a></sup>
it is my
judgment that large manufacturers and producers will
maintain wages and salaries as being the farsighted and
in the end the most constructive thing to do.<sup><a href="#Note-10-12">12</a></sup></blockquote>



<p>Until the end of 1931, most
businesses, and particularly the large
firms, staunchly resisted wage cuts. Some small firms in textiles
and coal reduced their wage rates, but the large firms in the basic
steel, public utility, and construction industries &ldquo;publicly
announced their adherence to a policy of high wages and their
unwillingness to reduce prevailing standards.&rdquo; Wolman
concluded
that &ldquo;it is indeed impossible to recall any past depression
of similar intensity and duration in which the wages of prosperity were
maintained as long as they have been during the depression of
1930&ndash;31.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-13">13</a></sup> He noted,
however, that pressures to cut wage rates
were building up almost irresistibly, and that some construction
labor had been able to maintain their employment by accepting <i>sub
rosa</i>wage cuts. Wage cuts responding to severe losses at the
end of
1931 took place secretly for fear of the disapproval of the Hoover
administration.<sup><a href="#Note-10-14">14 </a></sup></p>



<p>Secretary of the Treasury Mellon
summed up the administration&rsquo;s philosophy on wage rates in
May, 1931: <br/>



<blockquote>In this country, there has been a concerted and determined effort on
the part of both government and business not only to prevent any
reduction in wages but to
keep the maximum number of men employed, and
thereby to increase consumption. <br/>



<p>It must be remembered that the
all-important factor
is purchasing power, and purchasing power . . . is
dependent to a great extent on the standard of living . . .
that standard of living must be maintained at all costs.<sup><a href="#Note-10-15">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>


<p>The Federal government also did
its part by enacting the
Bacon&ndash;Davis Act, requiring a maximum eight-hour day on
construction of public buildings and the payment of at least the
&ldquo;prevailing wage&rdquo; in the locality. </p>



<p>It is no wonder that British
economist John Maynard Keynes,
in a memorandum to Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, reporting on a
visit to America in 1931, hailed the American record of
maintaining wage rates.<sup><a href="#Note-10-16">16</a></sup> Meanwhile, several
Governors (of New
York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming) went
beyond the Hoover voluntary work-sharing program to urge maximum-hour
legislation. </p>



<p>Amid the chorus of approval on
the Hoover wage program
there were only a few cool, dissenting voices. John Oakwood wrote
in <i>Barron&rsquo;s</i> that the modern
industrialists and labor leaders are saying, in effect, that
&ldquo;they intend to keep up wage levels even if they
have to close the mills.&rdquo; This may be fine for these leaders,
but not
so welcome to &ldquo;employees who have been deprived of their jobs
by
such rigid policies.&rdquo; Oakwood pointed out that on the free
market,
selling prices determine costs and not <i>vice versa</i>,
and that therefore
falling prices must be reflected in falling costs, else there will be
unemployment and declines in investment and production. Wage
rates are a basic part of production cost. Oakwood went on to
stress the essential distinction between wage rates and buying
power from wages. He pointed out that an individual&rsquo;s buying
power is really &ldquo;his ability to create goods or render
services that
have an exchange value for other goods or services,&rdquo; and that
the
worker will always tend to receive in wages the worth of his particular
productive service. True purchasing power is therefore
exchange power based upon production; if a good is in great
demand or in short supply, its purchasing power in terms of other
goods will be high; and if <i>vice versa</i> its
purchasing power will be
low. During the preceding boom, credit expansion had caused a
rise too high to be sustained, and the propaganda about a
&ldquo;new
era&rdquo; and a divinely-ordained American Standard of Living
created
the idea that this standard was some sort of vested divine right of
the American worker. Hugh Bancroft, publisher of <i>Barron&rsquo;s</i>,
wrote
that it was particularly necessary for wage rates to decline in the
producer goods&rsquo; industries in view of the great decline in
prices
there, and noted that real wage rates for the employed had
increased, so that the employed workers were profiteering at the
expense of the unemployed. Wage cuts were necessary to the
restoration of effective purchasing power.<sup><a href="#Note-10-17">17</a></sup></p>



<p>By the fall of 1931, economic
reality was at last beginning to
force its way through the tangle of mischievous fallacies, and the
severe pressures, of the Hoover program. Wage rates, at long last,
were beginning to fall. The U.S. Steel Corporation, over the
opposition of its President, James A. Farrell, summoned up the
courage to cut wage rates in September, whereupon William
Green accused U.S. Steel of violating its 1929 pledge to the President.<sup><a href="#Note-10-18">18</a></sup>
And even Henry Ford, despite his philosophic devotion to
the artificial wage maintenance policy, had to cut wages in the
following year. </p>



<center><h3>IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS</h3></center>

<p>Suspension of immigration also
helped to keep wage rates up,
and Hoover moved diligently on this front as well. In his December,
1930, message, Hoover urged Congress to enact the suspension of
immigration into law, where it would be more firmly rooted
than in Presidential decree. Bills to eliminate all immigration
except that of relatives of American residents were criticized by
Secretary of State Stimson for not going far enough. Stimson suggested
instead a general 90 percent reduction.<sup><a href="#Note-10-19">19</a></sup> This
new bill
passed the House, but failed to reach a vote in the Senate. </p>



<center><h3>VOLUNTARY RELIEF</h3></center>



Direct relief was just about the one sphere where President
Hoover seemed wholeheartedly to prefer voluntary to governmental
action. The previous fall, Hoover had refused to call a special
session of Congress for unemployment relief, saying this was the
responsibility of voluntary agencies. In fact, the voluntaryist
tradition was still so strong in this field that the Red Cross opposed
a
bill, in early 1931, to grant it $25 million for relief. The Red Cross
declared that its own funds were adequate, and its Chairman told
a House Committee that such a Congressional appropriation
would &ldquo;to a large extent destroy voluntary giving.&rdquo;
Many local Red
Cross leaders strongly opposed all federal aid, and even all public
relief generally, and so the bill, after passing the Senate, was killed
in the House.<sup><a href="#Note-10-20">20</a></sup> Many private charity
organizations, philanthropists, and social workers had the same views,
and the <i>New York
Times</i> hailed the &ldquo;voluntary spirit&rdquo; as
opposed to public aid.<sup><a href="#Note-10-21">21</a></sup> A
social worker, writing of this period, has said in obvious bewilderment
that:<br/>



<blockquote>the theory that
England&rsquo;s depression, which began
before the American disaster, had in some mysterious
way [sic] been connected with their unemployment
insurance system (or &ldquo;dole&rdquo;) had been accepted by
many
people in this country.<sup><a href="#Note-10-22">22</a></sup></blockquote>



<p>State and local direct relief,
however, totaled $176 million in 1931,
as compared to $105 million in 1930, and $71 million in 1929. The
Federal Government, while not engaging in direct relief, continued to
aid the farmers. In February, it appropriated $20 million for
loans to assist local agricultural credit corporations and granted $2
million for loans to various farmers. </p>




<p>Despite his initial voluntaryism
in this field, however, Hoover
appointed an Emergency Committee for Employment the previous
fall. He had appointed the committee reluctantly, and warned the
members that unemployment was strictly a local responsibility.<sup><a href="#Note-10-23">23</a></sup>
The chairman, Colonel Woods, however, kept urging upon
Hoover a highly interventionist program, including greater public
works, as well as Senator Wagner&rsquo;s bills for public works
planning
and a national employment service. Woods finally resigned in
April, 1931, and was replaced by Fred Croxton. In contrast to
Woods, many business leaders, understanding the role of the
British governmental unemployment &ldquo;dole&rdquo; in
creating and perpetuating unemployment, attacked any idea of
governmental
relief. These included Henry Ford, the leaders of the National
Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce, and
former President Coolidge. </p>



<center><h3>HOOVER IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 1931</h3></center>

<p>How, specifically, did President
Hoover rise to the challenge of
crisis in the latter part of 1931? In the first place, ominous signs
began to appear that he was getting ready to weaken or abandon
his devotion to the principle of voluntary relief. As early as June,
1930, the Conference of Governors had petitioned Hoover for a
one billion dollar emergency federal relief appropriation. Hoover
did not agree, but on February 3, he declared: <br/>



<blockquote>I am willing to pledge myself
that if the time should ever
come that the voluntary agencies of the country, together
with the local and state governments, are unable to find
resources with which to prevent hunger and suffering in
my country, I will ask aid of every resource of the Federal
Government.<sup><a href="#Note-10-24">24</a></sup></blockquote>



In mid-August, Hoover abolished
the old Woods&ndash;Croxton Emergency Committee for Employment, and
replaced it by a larger
President&rsquo;s Organization on Unemployment Relief. Head of the
new committee was Walter S. Gifford, President of American
Telephone and Telegraph Company. Others connected with the
new committee were: Newton D. Baker, Bernard M. Baruch, Fred
C. Croxton, John W. Davis, Pierre DuPont, John Edgerton,
William Green, Will Hays, Jacob Hollander, Alexander Legge,
Wesley C. Mitchell, William S. Paley, Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver,
Walter Teagle, William Allen White, Matthew Woll, and Owen D.
Young. While Gifford was personally opposed to governmental
unemployment relief, a subcommittee of the Organization on
Unemployment recommended, at the end of October, encouraging everyone
to buy, spurring confidence and combating hoarding,
urging banks to lend liberally and employers to spread available
work, increasing public works, and transferring surplus urban
labor to the farms.<sup><a href="#Note-10-25">25</a></sup></p>



<p>As early as mid-July, Hoover
returned to a favorite theme:
attacking short-selling, this time the wheat market. The short-selling
speculators were denounced for depressing prices and destroying
confidence; their unpatriotic &ldquo;intent is to take a profit
from the
losses of other people&rdquo;&mdash;a curious charge, since for
every short
seller there is necessarily a long buyer speculating on a rise. When
the crisis came in the fall, the Stock Exchange authorities,
undoubtedly influenced by Hoover&rsquo;s long-standing campaign
against such sales, restricted short selling. These restrictions
helped drive stock prices lower than they would have been otherwise,
since the short-seller&rsquo;s profit-taking is one of the main
supports for stock prices during a decline. As soon as the crisis
struck
in the fall, Hoover reverted to his favorite technique of holding
conferences. On September 15, he laid plans for a Conference on
Home Building and Home Ownership to be held in December, to
promote the widening of home ownership and to lower interest
rates on second mortgages. The resolutions of the December conference
originated many of the key features of later New Deal
housing policy, including heavy long-term credit at low rates of
interest and government aid to blighted, low-income housing.<sup><a href="#Note-10-26">26</a></sup></p>



<p>By October, as Britain left the
gold standard and gold reserves
dwindled, Hoover was subjected to contradictory pressures. On
the one hand, Hoover recalls with distaste that he was advised by
&ldquo;bitter-end liquidationists&rdquo; and
&ldquo;reactionary economists&rdquo; to let
&ldquo;the liquidation take its course until we found
bottom.&rdquo; On the
other hand, Governor Eugene Meyer, Jr., of the Federal Reserve
Board, had been agitating since summer to reenact a form of the
old War Finance Corporation for government loans to the private
economy, and now urged upon Hoover a special session of Congress for
this purpose. The former was the type of wise advice that
Hoover, devoid of laissez-faire principles or sound economic
knowledge, was incapable of understanding. Instead, he could only
worry about the immediate hardships that would arise from foreclosures,
declines in security prices, and bankruptcies. Staunchly
rejecting this &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; advice, and yet
reluctant to launch a
government lending program, Hoover resolved on a &ldquo;broad
program of defense and offense&rdquo; by mobilizing a
quasi-&ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;
lending agency to be financed by the nation&rsquo;s leading
bankers. The
first step was to call a secret conference of 40 leading New York
bankers and insurance executives at Secretary Mellon&rsquo;s
apartment
on October 4. Such men as Thomas W. Lamont and George
Whitney of J.P. Morgan and Company, Albert H. Wiggin of Chase
National Bank, and Charles E. Mitchell of National City Bank,
met with Secretary Mellon, Governor Meyer, Undersecretary
Mills, and Hoover. Hoover presented his plan&mdash;to create a
National Credit Corporation (NCC) with capitalization of $500
million to extend credit to banks in need and to permit banks to
extend credit to needy industrial firms. The banks were to finance
the capital for the NCC, and the NCC would be allowed to borrow up to
$1 billion, with Federal Reserve assistance. The idea was
that the strong banks would pool their resources to bail out the
weak banks; with Federal help, the NCC was to rediscount bank
assets not legally eligible to be rediscounted with the Federal
Reserve. Insurance companies were asked not to foreclose mortgages and,
in return, they would be helped by aid from the Federal
Farm Loan Banks. Although both Mills and Meyer enthusiastically
backed this program, the banks and the insurance companies
balked at the shoring up of unsound positions. At this point, the
iron fist became evident in the velvet glove of &ldquo;voluntary
industry&ndash;government cooperation&rdquo; in the Hoover
scheme of things. If
the banks did not agree, Hoover threatened, he would obtain legislation
to force their cooperation. The banks then agreed to set up
the NCC, and the insurance companies agreed not to press foreclosure of
mortgages. In return, Hoover promised that the NCC
would be temporary, for the duration of the year, and that he
would soon ask Congress to recreate a new and broader War
Finance Corporation (WFC) for emergency loans (the old WFC
had lapsed in the spring of 1929), to broaden eligibility requirements
for bank rediscounts with the Federal Reserve System, and
to expand the Federal Farm Loan Banks.<sup><a href="#Note-10-27">27</a></sup></p>



<p>In addition, Hoover induced Paul
Bestor, head of the Federal
Farm Loan Board, to promise to refuse foreclosing any mortgages
unless the debtor wanted to leave his farm, and the President
decided he would recommend an increased appropriation of $125
million for these land banks. Hoover also induced the Federal
Reserve Board to encourage banks to lend to depositors on the
latter&rsquo;s frozen assets in bankrupt banks. </p>



<p>The NCC quickly aided faltering
banks in South Carolina and
Louisiana, and, over a three-month period, loaned $153 million to
575 banks; but this hardly stemmed the tide of weakness and failure.
Strengthening Hoover&rsquo;s aim to establish a government lending
corporation&mdash;which was soon established as the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation&mdash;was the advice of Eugene Meyer, Ogden
Mills, Louis Wehle, formerly counsel of the old WFC, and
Chicago banker Melvin A. Traylor. Meyer, in particular, put pressure
upon the President, to the extent of preparing his own bill for
Congress. Hoover was finally completely persuaded to push for an
RFC by Meyer in early December.<sup><a href="#Note-10-28">28</a></sup></p>



<p>On October 7, Hoover called
another White House Conference
of the leading insurance, mortgage company, and building-and-loan
executives. He proposed to them a grandiose program&mdash;a
national
system of Federal mortgage discount banks, with one central bank,
like the Federal Reserve System, and with the capital subscribed by
the government. The regional banks would discount mortgages and
the central mortgage banks would stand behind the branches; all
could issue debentures to raise more capital. This system would
then stand behind all the mortgages of savings banks, insurance
companies, and commercial banks. This grandiose statist and
inflationist scheme was flatly rejected by the insurance companies and
by most of the savings banks, although it was supported by the
building-and-loan associations. Hoover therefore had to modify
his plan, and to settle for a Home Loan Bank system, which Congress
would later ratify, as a compulsory central mortgage bank for
the building-and-loan (now &ldquo;saving-and-loan&rdquo;)
associations, and a
voluntary bank for savings banks and insurance companies. </p>



<p>By early October, therefore, the
forthcoming Hoover New
Deal program for 1932 was already clear: the major measure, a
new government corporation to make loans to business&mdash;a
Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to replace the stopgap,
largely banker-financed National Credit Corporation; the broadening of
rediscount eligibility for the Federal Reserve; the creation
of a Home Loan Bank System to discount mortgages; and an
expansion of the Federal Farm Loan Bank System. </p>



<p>On October 27, a Presidential
committee of business, agricultural, and labor leaders, as well as
economists, endorsed the
prospective Hoover program, and called also for expansion of
credit, spreading of work, and especially public works. These
included Leonard P. Ayres, Fred C. Croxton, William Green,
Alvanley Johnston, and Wesley C. Mitchell. On December 21,
however, a highly unusual event occurred; another Presidential
Committee on Public Works condemned further public works,
urged a balanced budget, and readjustment to new conditions.
This committee included Leonard P. Ayres, Jacob Hollander,
Matthew Woll, and others. </p>



<center><h3>THE SPREAD OF COLLECTIVIST IDEAS IN THE BUSINESS WORLD</h3></center>

<p>Meanwhile, strange collectivist
plans for ending the depression
were brewing in the business world. In September, Gerard Swope,
head of General Electric, far surpassed the radicalism of his old
public-works proposal by presenting the Swope Plan to a convention of
the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The
Plan, which garnered a great deal of publicity, amounted to a call
for compulsory cartellization of American business&mdash;an
imitation
of fascism and an anticipation of the NRA. Every industry was to
be forcibly mobilized into trade associations, under Federal control,
to regulate and stabilize prices and production, and to prescribe trade
practices. Overall, the Federal Government, aided by
a joint administration of management and employees representing
the nation&rsquo;s industry, would &ldquo;coordinate production
and consumption.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-29">29</a></sup> To its grave
discredit, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
endorsed this socialistic plan in December by a large majority, as a
means of employing Federal coercion to restrict production and
raise prices. Leading the march for approval was the new President
of the U.S. Chamber, Henry I. Harriman, of the New England
Power Company. Harriman wrote, in his report of the Chamber&rsquo;s
Committee on the Continuity of Business and Employment, that
&ldquo;We have left the period of extreme individualism. . . .
Business prosperity and employment will be best maintained by an
intelligently
planned business structure.&rdquo; With business organized through
trade associations and headed by a National Economic Council, any
dissenting businessmen would be &ldquo;treated like any maverick. .
. .
They&rsquo;ll be roped, and branded, and made to run with the
herd.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-30">30</a></sup>
The president of the National Association of Manufacturers
wanted to go beyond the Swope Plan to forcibly include firms
employing less than fifty workers. </p>



<p>Also supporting the Swope Plan
were Swope&rsquo;s friend Owen D.
Young, Chairman of the Board of General Electric, President
Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University, who had been
thinking along the same lines, Royal W. France of Rollins College,
Karl T. Compton, the leftist Stuart Chase, and Charles F. Abbott
of the American Institute of Steel Construction. Abbott called the
Swope Plan:



<blockquote>a measure of public safety. . .
. We cannot have in this
country much longer irresponsible, ill-informed, stubborn and
non-cooperating individualism. . . . The
Swope Plan, seen in its ultimate simplicity, is not one
whit different in principle from the traffic cop . . . an
industrial traffic officer. . . ! Constitutional liberty to do
as you please is &ldquo;violated&rdquo; by the traffic
regulations&mdash;but
. . . they become binding even upon the blustering individual who
claims the right to do as he pleases.<sup><a href="#Note-10-31">31 </a></sup></blockquote>



Furthermore, former Secretary of
the Treasury William G.
McAdoo proposed a Federal &ldquo;Peace Industries Board&rdquo;
to adjust
national production to consumption, and Senator LaFollette
organized a subcommittee to investigate the possibility of a
National Economic Council to stabilize the economy&mdash;and Swope
was a leading witness. H.S. Person, managing director of the Taylor
Society, displayed the na&iuml;vete of the technocrat when he said,
in a puzzled way: &ldquo;we expect the greatest enterprise of all,
industry
as a whole, to get along without a definite plan.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-32">32</a></sup>
The historian
Charles A. Beard denounced laissez-faire and called for a Five Year
Plan of industrial cartels headed by a National Economic Council.
And the popular philosopher Will
Durant called for national planning by a national economic board,
ruling over boards for each
industry. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis suggested complete state
control of industry on the legal ground of public convenience and
necessity.<sup><a href="#Note-10-33">33</a></sup></p>



<p>Other business leaders were
thinking along similar lines. Benjamin A. Javits had developed a
similar plan in 1930. Dean Wallace B.
Donham, of the Harvard School of Business, had the gall to cite the
Soviet Union as showing the value and necessity of a &ldquo;general
plan
for American business.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-34">34</a></sup> Paul M.
Mazur, of Lehman Brothers,
referred to the &ldquo;tragic lack of planning&rdquo; of the
capitalist system.
Rudolph Spreckels, president of the Sugar Institute, urged governmental
allocation to each company of its proper share of market demand. Ralph
E. Flanders, of the Jones and Lamson Machine
Company, called for fulfillment of the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; of
the new stage of
governmental planning of the nation&rsquo;s economy. And Henry S.
Dennison, president of the Dennison Manufacturing Company,
developed his own Five Year Plan for a national cartel of organized
trade associations. </p>



<p>One of the most important
supporters of the cartellization idea
was Bernard M. Baruch, Wall Street financier. Baruch was influential
not only in the Democratic Party, but in the Republican as
well, as witness the high posts the Hoover administration accorded
to Baruch&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, Alexander Legge
and Eugene Meyer, Jr. As
early as 1925, Baruch, inspired by his stint as chief economic
mobilizer in World War I, conceived of an economy of trusts, regulated
and run by a Federal Commission, and in the spring of 1930,
Baruch proposed to the Boston Chamber of Commerce a
&ldquo;Supreme Court of Industry.&rdquo; McAdoo was
Baruch&rsquo;s oldest friend
in government; and Swope&rsquo;s younger brother, Herbert Bayard
Swope, was Baruch&rsquo;s closest confidant.<sup><a href="#Note-10-35">35</a></sup></p>



<p>Collectivist ideas had
apparently been fermenting in parts of
the business world ever since the depression began, as witness the
reaction of a writer in a prominent business magazine to the White
House Conferences for concerted maintenance of wage rates at the
end of 1929. Hailing the conference as Hoover&rsquo;s
&ldquo;splendid adventure in economic democracy,&rdquo; the
writer called for national economic planning through nationwide trade
associations and suggested coordination of the economy by
&ldquo;collective reason.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-36">36</a></sup></p>



<p>So far had the business world
gone, that a report for the leftwing National Progressive Conference of
1931, praised the Swope
Plan, albeit suggesting a less &ldquo;pro-business&rdquo; and
more egalitarian
twist to the scheme of centralized planning.<sup><a href="#Note-10-37">37</a></sup>
The entire collectivist movement in business was well summed up by one
of
Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s more extreme Brain Trusters, Rexford
Guy Tugwell, when he wrote of Harriman, Swope, and the rest
that they 



<blockquote>believed that more organization
was needed in American industry, more planning, more attempt to
estimate
needs and set production goals. From this they argued
that . . . investment to secure the needed investment
could be encouraged. They did not stress the reverse,
that other investments ought to be prohibited, but that
was inherent in the argument. All this was, so far, in
accord with the thought of the collectivists in Franklin&rsquo;s
Brains Trust who tended to think of the economy in
organic terms.<sup><a href="#Note-10-38">38</a></sup></blockquote>



<p>In short, Virgil Jordan,
economist for the National Industrial
Conference Board, was not far from the mark when he wrote that
businessmen were ready for an &ldquo;economic Mussolini.&rdquo;
</p>



<p>Despite all the pressure upon
him, Herbert Hoover staunchly
refused to endorse the Swope Plan or anything like it, and sturdily
attacked the plan as fascism.<sup><a href="#Note-10-39">39</a></sup> His speeches,
however, began to be
peppered with such ominous terms as &ldquo;cooperation&rdquo;
and &ldquo;elimination
of waste.&rdquo; In the slide toward intervention, meanwhile, the
Chamber
of Commerce also called for public works and Federal relief, and a
joint committee of the National Association of Manufacturers and
the National Industrial Council urged public works and regulation
of the purchasing power of the dollar. </p>



<p>The American Federation of Labor
also adopted a radical
Emergency Unemployment Program in October. As was to be
expected, it hailed the Hoover policy of keeping wage rates high
and cutting hours, and also advanced its own unionized version of
fascism. It proposed that the government force employers to hire
workers; 



<blockquote>Industries and employers should
therefore be given
quotas of jobs to be furnished, according to their ability
to provide work. The allocation of these quotas should
be the task of a central board, representing the Government and all
industrial groups.</blockquote>



This would ensure
&ldquo;effective organization of the labor market.&rdquo; In
short, the A.F. of L. wanted to have an equal share in running a
Swope Plan for industry.<sup><a href="#Note-10-40">40</a></sup></p>



<p>A further typically union scheme
was to compel restriction of
the labor supply, thus raising wage rates for the remainder of the
labor force. It is a curious &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for
unemployment, however, to
compel large groups of people to remain unemployed. Thus, the
A.F. of L. adopted as a slogan: &ldquo;Keep young persons in school
to
avoid their competing for jobs,&rdquo; and urged employers to fire
married women with working husbands; &ldquo;Married women whose
husbands have permanent positions which carry reasonable incomes
should be discriminated against in the hiring of employees.&rdquo;
It is a
measure of how far we have traveled in hypocrisy that unions
would not today publicly advocate these policies for such frankly
ruthless reasons; instead, they would undoubtedly be cloaked in
pieties about the glories of education and home life. </p>



<p>The A.F. of L. also endorsed
compulsory unemployment insurance at this convention, in contrast to
William Green&rsquo;s attack on
the government dole at the 1930 convention as turning the worker
into a &ldquo;ward of the State.&rdquo; The railroad union
leaders bellicosely
threatened Hoover with &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; if he did not act
to provide
employment and relief. </p>



<p>Particularly enthusiastic among
union leaders for the new drive
for government &ldquo;planning&rdquo; were John L. Lewis, of
the United
Mine Workers, and Sidney Hillman, of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers. Both called for a national economic council for planning
to include labor and management representatives. Schlesinger is
certainly correct when he says that &ldquo;Lewis and Hillman, in
the
end, differed little from Gerard Swope and Henry I. Harriman.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-10-41">41</a></sup></p>



<p>The A.F. of L. also praised the
Hoover administration for carrying out the following objectives during
1930&ndash;1931: maintaining
wage rates on public buildings, reduction of hours in government
employ without a reduction in pay, public works planning, raising of
wages for some government employees, increased appropriation for
border immigration patrol (thus &ldquo;relieving
unemployment&rdquo; by preventing Mexicans from coming here to
improve their condition),
appropriations for naval ships, and requiring all new naval work to
be done in navy yards and arsenals instead of on private contract. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the states moved in
to compel cartellization and
virtual socialization of the crude oil industry. The oil-producing
states enacted laws to enable governmental commissions to fix the
maximum amount of oil produced, and this system is basically still
in effect. The state laws were enacted under the public guise of
&ldquo;conservation,&rdquo; which is a pat excuse for any
compulsory monopoly or cartel in a natural resource. In 1931, new oil
discoveries in
East Texas drove the price of crude down from one dollar a barrel
to 22 cents a barrel, and cartelists and conservationists set up a
hue and cry. The lead was taken by Oklahoma's Governor
&ldquo;Alfalfa
Bill&rdquo; Murray, who ordered a general shutdown of the crude oil
industry until the price of oil should rise to the &ldquo;minimum
fair
price&rdquo; of one dollar a barrel. When some producers proved
recalcitrant, Murray sent the Oklahoma National Guard into the oil
fields to enforce his decree with bayonets. Soon, Texas followed
suit, and the leading oil states of California, Texas, Kansas, and
Oklahoma passed &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; and proration laws
to fix production ceilings in a more orderly manner. Two emergency
sessions of
the Texas legislature were called to broaden the oil-regulating
powers of the Texas Railroad Commission, after it had suffered
unfavorable court injunctions. </p>



<p>The oil states also organized an
Oil States Advisory Committee
to decide on quotas&mdash;soon to become an interstate
compact&mdash;and
a &ldquo;Voluntary Committee&rdquo; of the Federal Oil
Conservation Board
aided in the effort. Some well owners found that they could evade
the troops and decrees and smuggle &ldquo;hot oil&rdquo; out of
the state, but
this &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; of freedom was finally closed by
the New Deal. To
bolster the oil cartel, the Federal budget of 1932 included a tariff
on imported crude oil and on petroleum products. This made the
domestic cartel more effective, but it also reduced American
exports of petroleum.<sup><a href="#Note-10-42">42</a></sup> It is, of course,
curious to find a restriction
on <i>imports</i>
imposed as part of a domestic resource <i>conservation</i>
program, but we find the same phenomena today. If conservation were
really the goal, then surely imports would have been encouraged to
ease demands on domestic oil. </p>



<p>Let it not be thought that
Hoover was idle in this movement.
Even before the depression, he was considering coercive restrictions on
oil production. The President canceled permits to drill for
oil in, large parts of the public domain, and he and Secretary of
Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur were in large part responsible for the
new state &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; laws. Hoover and Wilbur
also pressured
private oil operators near the public domain into agreements to
restrict oil production.<sup><a href="#Note-10-43">43</a></sup></p>



<p>As 1931 drew to a close and
another Congressional session
drew near, the country and indeed the world were in the midst of
an authentic crisis atmosphere&mdash;a crisis of policy and of
ideology.
The depression, so long in effect, was now rapidly growing worse,
in America and throughout the world. The stage was set for the
&ldquo;Hoover New Deal&rdquo; of 1932.</p>
