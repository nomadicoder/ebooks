	<h4>Chapter 2</h4>


	
	<a name="Note-2-1"><small><p><sup>1</sup>
	F.A. Hayek subjected J.M. Keynes&rsquo;s early&nbsp;<i>Treatise
	on Money</i> (now relatively
	forgotten amid the glow of his later&nbsp;<i>General Theory</i>)
	to a sound and searching critique, much of which applies to the later
	volume. Thus, Hayek pointed out that
	Keynes simply assumed that zero aggregate profit was just sufficient to
	maintain
	capital, whereas profits in the lower stages combined with equal losses
	in the
	higher stages would reduce the capital structure; Keynes ignored the
	various
	stages of production; ignored changes in capital value and neglected
	the identity
	between entrepreneurs and capitalists; took replacement of the capital
	structure
	for granted; neglected price differentials in the stages of production
	as the source
	of interest; and did not realize that, ultimately, the question faced
	by businessmen
	is not whether to invest in consumer goods or capital goods, but
	whether to invest
	in capital goods that will yield consumer goods at a {nearer
	or later} date. In general, Hayek found Keynes ignorant of
	capital theory and real-interest theory, particularly that of
	B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, a criticism borne out in Keynes&rsquo;s
	remarks on
	Mises&rsquo;s theory of interest. See John Maynard Keynes,&nbsp;<i>The
	General Theory of
	Employment, Interest, and Money</i> (New York: Harcourt,
	Brace,
	1936), pp. 192&ndash;93;

	J.M. Keynes,&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Economica</i>

	Some of the most damaging blows to the Keynesian system have come from
	friendly, but unsparing, neo-Keynesian sources; e.g., Franco
	Modigliani,
	&ldquo;Liquidity Preference and the Theory of Interest and
	Money,&rdquo; in Henry Hazlitt,
	ed.,&nbsp;<i>The
	Critics of Keynesian Economics</i> (Princeton,
	N.J.: D. Van Nostrand, 1960),
	pp. 131&ndash;84; Erik Lindahl, &ldquo;On Keynes&rsquo;
	Economic System,&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Economic Record</i>
	(May
	and November, 1954): 19&ndash;32, 159&ndash;71. As Hutt sums
	up:
	

	<blockquote>[T]he apparent revolution wrought by Keynes after 1936 has
	been
	reversed by a bloodless counterrevolution conducted unwittingly by
	higher critics who tried very hard to be faithful. Whether some
	permanent
	benefit to our science will have made up for the destruction which the
	revolution left in its train, is a question which economic historians
	of the
	future will have to answer.</blockquote></p>

	<a name="Note-2-8"><small><p><sup>8</sup> Actually, zones
	of
	indeterminacy are apt to be
	wide where only two or three
	people live on a desert island and narrow progressively the greater the

	<a name="Note-2-10"><small><p><sup>10</sup> Maximum wage controls,
	such as prevailed in earlier centuries and in the Second World War,
	created artificial shortages of labor throughout the

	<a name="Note-2-12"><small><p><sup>12</sup> Various
	empirical studies have maintained that
	the aggregate demand for
	labor is highly elastic in a depression, but the argument here does not
	rest upon
	them. See Benjamin M. Anderson, &ldquo;The Road Back to Full
	Employment,&rdquo; in&nbsp;Paul T. Homan and Fritz Machlup,
	eds. <i>Financing
	American Prosperity</i> (New York:
	Twentieth Century Fund, 1945), pp. 20&ndash;21.</p></small></a>

	<a name="Note-2-14"><small><p><sup>14</sup>
	Note that, in Figure 1, the S<sub>L</sub> S<sub>L</sub>
	line stops before reaching the horizontal
	axis. Actually, the line must stop at the wage yielding the minimum
	subsistence
	income. Below that wage rate, no one will work, and therefore, the
	supply curve
	of labor will really be horizontal, on the free market, at the minimum
	subsistence
	point. Certainly it will not be possible for speculative withholding to
	reduce wage
	rates to the subsistence level, for three reasons: (a) this speculative
	withholding
	almost always results in <i>hoarding</i>,
	which reduces
	prices all-round and which will
	therefore reduce the equilibrium money wage rate without reducing the
	equilibrium real wage rate&mdash;the relevant rate for the
	subsistence level, (b) entrepreneurs
	will realize that their speculation has overshot the mark long before
	the subsistence level is reached; and (c) this is especially true in an
	advanced capitalist economy, where the rates are far above subsistence.</p></small></a>



	<a name="Note-2-15"><small><p><sup>15</sup>
	On the other hand, wage rates maintained above the free-market level
	will
	discourage investment and thereby tend to increase hoarding at the
	expense of
	saving&ndash;investment. This decline in the
	investment&ndash;consumption ratio aggravates
	the depression further. Freely declining wage rates would permit
	investments to
	return to previous proportions, thus adding another important impetus
	to recovery. See Frederic Benham, <i>British
	Monetary Policy</i> (London:
	P.S. King and Son,
	1932), p. 77. </p></small></a>



	<a name="Note-2-16"><small><p><sup>16</sup>
	It has often been maintained that a failing price level injures
	business firms
	because it aggravates the burden of fixed monetary debt. However, the
	creditors
	of a firm are just as much its owners as are the equity shareholders.
	The equity
	shareholders have less equity in the business to the extent of its
	debts. Bond-holders (long-term creditors) are just different types of
	owners, very much as preferred and common stock holders exercise their
	ownership rights differently.
	Creditors save money and invest it in an enterprise, just as do
	stockholders.
	Therefore, no change in price level by itself helps or hampers a
	business; creditor&ndash;owners and debtor&ndash;owners may
	simply divide their gains (or losses) in different proportions. These
	are mere intra-owner controversies.</p></small></a>
