<h3>1930 </h3>


</b></div>


<p><font size="+2"><b>B</b></font>y early 1930, people were
generally convinced that there was
little to worry about. Hoover&rsquo;s decisive actions on so many
fronts&mdash;wages, construction, public works, farm supports,
etc., indicated to the public
that this time swift national planning
would turn the tide quickly. Farm prices then seemed to be recovering,
and unemployment had not yet reached catastrophic proportions,
averaging less than 9 percent of the labor force in 1930.
Such leaders as Hoover, William Green, and Charles Schwab
issued buoyantly optimistic statements about early recovery, and
Hoover was hailed on all sides as a great statesman. At the end of
June, Hoover urged further state and city action to expand public
works and thus cure unemployment, and on July 3rd, Congress
authorized the expenditure of a giant $915 million public works
program, including a Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. </p>



<center><h3>MORE INFLATION</h3></center>



<p>Dr. Anderson records that, at the end of December, 1929, the
leading Federal Reserve officials wanted to pursue a laissez-faire
policy: &ldquo;the disposition was to let the money market
&lsquo;sweat it out&rsquo;
and reach monetary ease by the wholesome process of
liquidation.&rdquo;
The Federal Reserve was prepared to let the money market find its
own level, without providing artificial stimuli that could only prolong
the crisis.<sup><a href="#Note-9-1">1</a></sup> But early in 1930, the government
instituted a
<!--page239-->
massive easy money program.
Rediscount rates of the New York
Fed fell from 42 percent in February to 2 percent by the end of
the year. Buying rates on acceptances, and the call loan rate, fell
similarly. At the end of August, Governor Roy Young of the Federal
Reserve Board resigned, and was replaced by a more thoroughgoing
inflationist, Eugene Meyer, Jr., who had been so active
in government lending to farmers. During the entire year, 1930,
total member bank reserves increased by $116 million. Controlled
reserves rose by $209 million; $218 million consisted of an
increase in government securities held. Gold stock increased by
$309 million, and there was a net increase in member bank
reserves of $116 million. Despite this increase in reserves, the total
money supply (including all money-substitutes) remained almost
constant during the year, falling very slightly from $73.52 billion
at the end of 1929 to $73.27 billion at the end of 1930. There
would have been a substantial rise were it not for the shaky banks
which were forced to contract their operations in view of the general
depression. Security issues increased, and for a while stock
prices rose again, but the latter soon fell back sharply, and
production and employment kept falling steadily. </p>



<p>A leader in the easy money policy
of late 1929 and 1930 was
once more the New York Federal Reserve, headed by Governor
George Harrison. The Federal Reserve, in fact, began the inflationist
policy on its own. Inflation would have been greater in 1930
had not the stock market boom collapsed in the spring, and if not
for the wave of bank failures in late 1930.<sup><a href="#Note-9-2">2</a></sup> The
inflationists were not
satisfied with events, and by late October, <i>Business Week </i>thundered
denunciation of the alleged &ldquo;deflationists in the
saddle,&rdquo; supposedly inspired by the largest commercial and
investment banks.<sup><a href="#Note-9-3">3</a></sup></p>



<center><h3>THE SMOOT&ndash;HAWLEY TARIFF</h3></center>



<p>In mid-1930, another chicken born in 1929 came home to
roost. One of Hoover&rsquo;s first acts upon becoming President was
to
hold a special session on tariffs, beginning in the spring of 1929.
Whereas we have seen that a policy of high tariffs cum foreign
loans was bound to hurt the farmers&rsquo; export markets when the
loans tapered off, Hoover&rsquo;s answer was to raise tariffs still
further,
on agricultural and on manufactured products. A generation later,
Hoover was still to maintain that a high tariff <i>helps</i>
the farmer by
building up his domestic market and lessening his
&ldquo;dependence&rdquo;
on export markets, which means, in fact, that it hurts him grievously
by destroying his export markets.<sup><a href="#Note-9-4">4</a></sup> Congress
continued to
work on a higher tariff, and finally reported a bill in mid-1930,
which Hoover signed approvingly. In short, it was at a precarious
time of depression that the Hoover administration chose to hobble
international trade, injure the American consumer, and cripple the
American farmers&rsquo; export markets by raising tariffs higher
than
their already high levels. Hoover was urged to veto the
Smoot&ndash;Hawley Tariff by almost all the nation&rsquo;s
economists, in a
remarkable display of consensus, by the leading bankers, and by
many other leaders. The main proponents were the Progressive
bloc, the three leading farm organizations, and the American Federation
of Labor. </p>



<p>No one had advocated higher
tariffs during the 1928 campaign,
and Hoover originated the drive for a higher tariff in an effort to
help the farmers by raising duties on agricultural products. When
the bill came to the House, however, it added tariffs on many other
products. The increased duties on agriculture were not very important,
since farm products were generally <i>export</i>
commodities, and
little was imported. Duties were raised on sugar to &ldquo;do
something
for&rdquo; the Western beet-sugar farmer; on wheat to subsidize the
marginal Northwestern wheat farmers at the expense of their
Canadian neighbors; on flaxseed to protect the Northwest farmers
against Argentina; on cotton to protect the marginal Imperial Valley
farmer against Egypt; on cattle and dairy products to injure the
Canadian border trade; on hides, leather, and shoes; on wool, wool
rags, and woolen textiles; on agricultural chemicals; on meat to
hamper imports from Argentina; on cotton textiles to relieve this
&ldquo;depressed industry&rdquo;; on velvets and other silks;
on decorated
china, surgical instruments, and other glass instruments; on pocket
knives and watch movements.<sup><a href="#Note-9-5">5</a></sup> The tariff rates
were now the highest in American history. </p>



<p>The stock market broke sharply on
the day that Hoover agreed
to sign the Smoot&ndash;Hawley Bill. This bill gave the signal for
protectionism to proliferate all over the world. Markets, and the
international division of labor, were hampered, and American consumers
were further burdened, and farm as well as other export
industries were hindered by the ensuing decline of international
trade. </p>



<p>One prominent protectionist drive
was put on by the silver
bloc. In February, the mining interests suggested an international
monetary conference to raise and then stabilize silver prices, as
well as to levy a tariff on silver. The resolution was put through the
Senate in February, 1931, but the State Department could not
interest foreign governments in such a conference. Main supporters of
this price-raising scheme were the Western governors, at the
behest of the American Silver Producers&rsquo; Association,
Senators
such as Key Pittman of Nevada and Reed Smoot of Utah, J.H.
Hammond, a mining engineer, Rend Leon, a New York banker,
and F.H. Brownell, President of the American Smelting and Refining
Company. </p>



<center><h3>HOOVER IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1930</h3></center>

<p>During the second half of 1930, production, prices, foreign
trade, and employment continued to decline. On July 29, Hoover
called for an investigation of bankruptcy laws in order to weaken
them and prevent many bankruptcies&mdash;thus turning to the
ancient
device of attempting to revive confidence by injuring creditors and
propping up unsound positions. In August, it was revealed that
merchant shipping construction had swelled from 170,000 tons in
July, 1929, to 487,000 tons in July, 1930&mdash;due to Federal
subsidies.
On September 9, Hoover took an unusual step: to relieve the
unemployment problem, and also to help keep wage rates up, the
President effectively banned further immigration into the United
States, and did so through a mere State Department press
announcement. The decree barred all but the wealthiest immigrants as
&ldquo;public charges,&rdquo; in a few months reducing
immigration
from Europe by 90 percent. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough,
Hoover&rsquo;s high-handed action came in
defiance of previous Congressional refusal to agree to his proposal
to cut immigration quotas in half, and it also came after the Senate
had rejected a bill to suspend all immigration except by relatives
for five years, offered by Senator Hugo Black (D., Ala.). Typical of
the restrictionist, wage-raising arguments for blocking immigration was
the charge of Senator Black that &ldquo;foreign immigration has
been utilized by the big business interests of the country as a direct
weapon to break down the price of wages of the people of the
land.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-9-6">6</a></sup> As might have been expected,
William Green warmly
endorsed Hoover&rsquo;s stand. </p>



<p>Reducing the labor force as a
&ldquo;cure&rdquo; for unemployment is similar to
&ldquo;curing&rdquo; a surplus of a certain commodity by
passing a law
prohibiting anyone from selling the product, and anticipated
Hitler&rsquo;s &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for unemployment by
forcibly sending married
women back to the home. Hoover also records that he accelerated
the deportation of &ldquo;undesirable&rdquo; aliens, again
helping to ease the
unemployment picture. He deported sixteen to twenty thousand
aliens per year.<sup><a href="#Note-9-7">7</a></sup> As a consequence, while the
immigration law had
already reduced net immigration into the United States to about
200,000 per year, Hoover&rsquo;s decree reduced net immigration to
35,000 in 1931, and in 1932 there was a net emigration of 77,000.
In addition, Hoover&rsquo;s Emergency Committee on Employment
organized concerted propaganda to urge young people to return to
school in the fall, and thus leave the labor market. </p>



<p>At the end of July, Hoover
organized a planning conference of
leading organizations, designed to widen home ownership and bolster
shaky home mortgages. The Planning Committee established by
Hoover included representatives of the National Association of Real
Estate Boards, the American Federation of Labor, the American
Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the National
Grange, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Institute of
Architects, and the American Home Economic Association.</p>



<p>By October, Hoover apparently
felt that the time had come for
self-congratulation. In an address to the American Bankers&rsquo;
Association, he summed up his multi-faceted intervention as follows: 



<blockquote>I determined that it was my duty,
even without precedent, to call upon the business of the country for
coordinated and constructive action to resist the forces of
disintegration. The business community, the bankers,
labor, and the government have cooperated in wider
spread measures of mitigation than have ever been
attempted before. Our bankers and the reserve system
have carried the country through the credit . . . storm
without impairment. Our leading business concerns
have sustained wages, have distributed employment,
have expedited heavy construction. The Government
has expanded public works, assisted in credit to agriculture, and has
restricted immigration. These measures
have maintained a higher degree of consumption than
would otherwise have been the case. They have thus
prevented a large measure of unemployment. . . . Our
present experience in relief should form the basis of
even more amplified plans in the future. </blockquote>



<p>So they did form the
basis&mdash;of plans that aggravated the depression even further.
To the bankers, Hoover delivered his pet theory
of the crash: that it was caused by credit being too scarce to
commercial borrowers, it being unduly &ldquo;absorbed&rdquo; by
speculation. He
hailed the Federal Reserve System as the great instrument of promoting
stability, and called for an &ldquo;ample supply of credit at low
rates of interest,&rdquo; as well as public works, as the best
methods of
ending the depression. </p>



<p>The wage agreement that Hoover
had extracted at the White
House Conferences unfortunately held firm for a long while, thus
becoming the prime generator of unemployment. Hoover still
proudly records that the wage agreement lasted in the organized
trades throughout his term, while most of the non-union employers also
complied. In August, William Green had praised the stabilizing effects
of Hoover&rsquo;s program, emphasizing its success in maintaining
wage rates. And in October, when Green presented Hoover
to the annual Convention of the A.F. of L., he was exuberant:



<blockquote>The great influence which
[Hoover] exercised upon that
occasion [the White House Conferences] served to
maintain wage standards to prevent a general reduction
of wages. As we emerge from this distressing period of
unemployment we . . . understand and appreciate the
value of the service which the President rendered the
wage earners of the country. </blockquote>



Green had no doubt that Hoover&rsquo;s
&ldquo;great influence served to maintain wage standards and
prevent a general reduction of wages.&rdquo; </p>

<p>In his address before
the Convention, Hoover returned to the
glorious theme of the White House Conferences: 

<blockquote>At these White House Conferences
the leaders of business and industry undertook to do their utmost to
maintain the rate of wages. </blockquote>



and to distribute work among the
employees. He hailed the success of that pledge, for the


<blockquote>great manufacturing companies,
the railways, utilities,
and business houses have been able to maintain the
established wages. Employers have spread their employment
systematically. </blockquote>



The spreading of employment was,
in fact, a spreading of unemployment, and helped to maintain the
existing wage scales by keeping these unemployed off the labor market.
Hoover virtually
admitted this when he said: 



<blockquote>Through distribution of
employment large numbers of
workers have been saved from being forced into competition for new
jobs. </blockquote>



Another evil in this work-sharing
program was that employers
were not permitted to discharge their least marginally-productive
workers&mdash;those whose productivity was below the artificially
high
wage-rates. Hence, costs to the employers became greater, and
they suffered aggravated losses. </p>



<p>Hoover also commended the
businessmen for their great resolution in maintaining wage scales even
in the face of falling prices,<sup><a href="#Note-9-8">8</a></sup>
and pointed out that public works had &ldquo;taken up the
slack&rdquo; and
that railroads and public utilities had been induced to increase
their construction by $500 million. </p>



<p>Also in October, Hoover launched
the first of repeated attacks
against his old <i>bete noire</i>: the New York Stock
Exchange. He threatened Federal regulation of the Exchange despite the
fact that it was
wholly under the jurisdiction of New York State and that therefore
such regulation would be patently unconstitutional. Hoover forced
Richard Whitney, head of the Exchange, to agree
&ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; to
withhold loans of stock for purposes of short-selling. Short-selling
was&mdash;and usually is&mdash;the chief object of attack by
demagogues
who believed that short sales were somehow fundamentally
responsible for falling stock prices, thereby forgetting that for
every short seller there must necessarily be a buyer, and also that
short-selling accelerates the necessary depression&ndash;adjustment
in
stock prices. Senator Smith Brookbart of Iowa had, as early as January,
1930, introduced a bill to prohibit all short selling.</p>



<p>In the same month, Hoover formed
a nationwide organization
for the relief of distress. Colonel Arthur Woods was appointed to
head the President&rsquo;s Emergency Committee for Employment; in
the group were Fred C. Croxton, Edward Bernays, and Dr. Lillian
Gilbreth.<sup><a href="#Note-9-9">9</a></sup> As in Hoover&rsquo;s previous
venture in 1921, the committee
organized committees in each state and locality for unemployment
relief. Shortly afterward, Hoover again asked for enlarged Federal
public works appropriations. One public work already begun in
September was the appropriately named &ldquo;Hoover Dam&rdquo;
in Arizona, a government project to sell water and electric power. The
New Deal was later happy to complete the project, as it also did
with the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River, and with
dams in the Central Valley of California.<sup><a href="#Note-9-10">10</a></sup><br/></p>



<p>In Hoover&rsquo;s second annual message in December, the President,
while conceding that factory employment had fallen by 16
percent since 1928, and manufacturing production had declined by
20 percent, proudly pointed out that consumption and wage rates
had held to their former levels, bank deposits were 5 percent
higher, and department store sales only 7 percent less. Unfortunately,
Hoover did not attempt to relate these movements, or to
realize that the declines of employment and production were the
consequences of policies that bolstered consumption and wage
rates. Hoover conceded that wheat and cotton prices were 40 percent
below 1928, and farm prices 20 percent lower, but he hailed
the achievement of the FFB in keeping wheat prices 50 percent
higher than that of Canada, and wool prices 80 percent higher
than in Denmark. Hoover apparently never saw that keeping
prices above the world market would be self-defeating, since few
customers would buy American products at prices artificially
higher than they could obtain abroad. </p>



<p>In keeping with the general tone
of optimism, the American
Economic Association stated at year&rsquo;s end that recovery in
the
spring of 1931 seemed assured. More astute than these
&ldquo;established&rdquo; economists were a few others who
operated with better
theoretical tools. Thus, at the end of July, H. Parker Willis
charged, in an editorial in the <i>New York Journal of Commerce</i>,
that
the current easy money policy of the Federal Reserve was causing
the increase in bank failures, &ldquo;chiefly due to [their]
inability to liquidate.&rdquo; Willis pointed out that the country
was suffering from
frozen and wasteful malinvestments in plants, buildings, and other
capital, and that the depression would only be cured when these
unsound credit positions were liquidated.<sup><a href="#Note-9-11">11</a></sup> The
economist Joseph
Stagg Lawrence upheld thrift and attacked the prevalent idea that
consumption led to prosperity. He pointed out that purchases of
consumer goods were being maintained, while the main declines
were taking place in producers&rsquo; goods industries, such as
construction, steel, and freight traffic.<sup><a href="#Note-9-12">12</a></sup></p>



<p>One of the best counsels on the
depression was set forth in an
annual report by Albert H. Wiggin, chairman of the board of the
Chase National Bank, in January, 1931. We can assume that he was
helped in making the report by Dr. Benjamin M. Anderson, economist for
the bank. Wiggin called for the reduction of the Federal
capital gains tax, pointing out that the 122 percent tax on realized
capital gains induced people to hold onto their stock rather than
sell during the boom, and then fostered selling during a depression, in
order to take the realized stock losses. Wiggin also urged
reduction in the tariff, noting that we had merely delayed the
adverse effects of the protective tariff from 1924 until 1929 by
heavy purchase of foreign bonds. With the decline in the foreign
bond market, foreign countries no longer had the funds to purchase
our exports. Only a reduction in our tariffs would permit American
exports to flourish. Wiggin further pointed out that production had
declined far more than consumption, thus indicating that it was not
lack of &ldquo;purchasing power&rdquo; that was causing the
depression. Finally,
he noted that in the 1921 depression, costs and wages had been
quickly scaled down, and unsound activities liquidated: </p>



<p>Past costs of production were
forgotten, and goods were
sold for what the market would pay . . . [but] we
attempted, as a matter of collective policy, to hold the
line firm following the crash of 1929. Wages were not to
be reduced, buying by railroads and construction by
public utilities were to be increased, prices were to be
maintained, and cheap money was to be the foundation.
The policy has . . . failed. . . . It is bad policy for a government,
or for an industry by concerted act, to try to
keep prices permanently above the level which the supply and demand
situation justifies. . . . We must keep the
markets open and prices free. It is not true that high
wages make prosperity. Instead, prosperity makes high
wages. When wages are kept higher than the market situation justifies,
employment and the buying-power of
labor fall off. . . . Our depression has been prolonged
and not alleviated by delay in making necessary readjustments.<sup><a href="#Note-9-13">13</a></sup></p>



<p>Unfortunately, Wiggin&rsquo;s wise
advice went unheeded. </p>



<center><h3>THE PUBLIC WORKS AGITATION</h3></center>



<p>While a few economists gave sound advice to little avail, scores of
others helped make matters worse by agitating for a broad public
works program. The Employment Stabilization Act had first been
introduced into the Senate by Senator Robert Wagner of New
York in 1928, under the inspiration of the veteran public works
agitator Otto Tod Mallery as part of a comprehensive plan of government
intervention to combat unemployment.<sup><a href="#Note-9-14">14</a></sup></p>



<p>The act provided for an
Employment Stabilization Board, consisting of several Cabinet officers,
to increase public works in order
to stabilize industry and relieve unemployment in a depression. In
early 1930, Senator Wagner seized the opportunity to introduce
his program again. He asserted, with due consistency, that since we
now had a Federal tariff and a Federal Reserve System, why not
also accept the responsibility for unemployment? No one thought
to answer Wagner that his logic could be turned around to indicate
repeal of both the protective tariff and the Federal Reserve.
Wagner&rsquo;s bill authorized $150 million per annum for his
program. </p>



<p>The California Joint Immigration
Committee presented as an
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; to the Wagner Bill a proposal of its
own to restrict
immigration, thus preventing aliens from competing with highwage
American workers, and preventing them from breaking down
an artificial wage scale. This bill was supported by the American
Legion of California, the California Federation of Labor, and the
Native Sons of the Golden West. Hoover granted their request in
September. For the Wagner Bill, the main witnesses in the Senate
were the inevitable John B. Andrews of the American Association for
Labor Legislation, William Green, Frances Perkins, Norman Thomas
of the Socialist Party, and James A. Emery of the National Association
of Manufacturers. There was, indeed, very little opposition in the
Senate: Senator Hiram Johnson (R., Calif.), head of the subcommittee
considering the measure, approved, as did Senator Vandenberg (R.,
Mich.) and President Hoover. An outpouring of the
nation&rsquo;s economists endorsed the Wagner Bill, in petitions
presented to Congress by Professors Samuel Joseph of the City College
of New York, and Joseph P. Chamberlain of Columbia University.
Joseph&rsquo;s petition asserted that the bill laid the foundation
for a national program to relieve unemployment, and that the
principle of public works was &ldquo;widely accepted&rdquo; by
economists as
a means of stimulating construction and putting men to work.<sup><a href="#Note-9-15">15</a></sup></p>



<p>The Senate passed the Wagner Bill
by an unrecorded vote. The
bill ran into delays in the House despite the almost complete lack
of opposition in the hearings and the pressure for the bill exerted
by Andrews, Green, Perkins, Emery, Douglas, Foster and Catchings.
Representative George S. Graham (R., Penn.), Chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, managed to amend the substance out of
the bill, and thus to deadlock the Senate&ndash;House Conference
and
block the bill.<sup><a href="#Note-9-16">16</a></sup> In the meanwhile, Congress
approved the various
Hoover requests for additional public works appropriations,
although one $150 million request was cut to $116 million. </p>



<p>In December, 1930, the Emergency
Committee for Federal
Public Works, headed by Harold S. Butenheim, editor of <i>American
City</i>, appealed for large-scale borrowing of one billion
dollars for
public works, and the plea was endorsed by 93 leading economists.
Among these were Thomas S. Adams, Thomas Nixon Carver,
Edgar S. Furniss, Edwin R.A. Seligman, Leo Wolman, and many
of the names on the Wagner Bill petitions.<sup><a href="#Note-9-17">17</a></sup>
Finally, in February,
1931, Congress passed the Employment Stabilization Act in original form
and Hoover gladly signed the measure. He quickly designated the
Secretary of Commerce as chairman of the Federal</p>




<p>Employment Stabilization Board.<sup><a href="#Note-9-18">18
</a></sup>The Senate also did something
in the same month destined to have far-reaching effects in the
future: it passed the Wagner resolution to study the establishment
of Federal unemployment insurance. </p>



<p>Behind the scenes, Gerard Swope,
president of General Electric,
urged a much larger public works plan upon Hoover. In September,
1930, Swope proposed to Hoover an immediate one billion dollar
bond issue for Federal public works, to be matched by another one
billion dollars similarly raised by state and local governments,
under Federal guarantee. Swope&rsquo;s favorite argument was to
point
to wartime, with its bold national planning, as the ideal to be
emulated. Fortunately, Hoover&rsquo;s own leanings in this
direction were
much too cautious to allow the adoption of Swope&rsquo;s proposal.<sup><a href="#Note-9-19">19
</a></sup></p>



<p>Also urging Hoover further than
he would go was Colonel
Arthur Woods, head of the President&rsquo;s Emergency Committee for
Employment, who suggested a $750 million federal&ndash;state
publicworks program, including a Federal Reconstruction Board for
loans to states for public works.<sup><a href="#Note-9-20">20</a></sup></p>



<center><h3>THE FISCAL BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT</h3></center>


<P>In the pleasant but illusory world of &ldquo;national product
statistics,&rdquo;
government expenditures on goods and services constitute <i>an
addition to </i>the nation&rsquo;s product. Actually, since
government&rsquo;s revenue, in
contrast to all other institutions, is coerced from the taxpayers
rather
than paid voluntarily, it is far more realistic to regard all
government
expenditures as a <i>depredation upon</i>, rather than an
addition to, the
national product. In fact, either government expenditures or
receipts, whichever is the higher, may be regarded as the burden on
private national product, and subtraction of the former figure from
Gross Private Product (GPP) will yield an estimate of the private
product left in private hands. The ratio of government depredation
(government expenditures or receipts, whichever is the higher) over
Gross Private Product yields the approximate percentage of government
depredation of the private product of the economy.<sup><a href="#Note-9-21">21</a></sup></p>



<p>In a depression, it is
particularly important that the government&rsquo;s fiscal burden on
the economy be reduced. In the first place,
it is especially important at such a time to free the economy from
the heavy load of government&rsquo;s acquiring resources, and
second, a
lowering of the burden will tend to shift total spending so as to
increase investment and lower consumption, thus providing a double
impetus toward curing a depression. </p>



<p>How did the government react when
the 1929 depression hit?
Were fiscal burdens on the economy raised or lowered? Fortunately,
detailed statistics are available from 1929 on, permitting us
to estimate the answer to that question. In 1929, the Gross
National Product (GNP) was $104.4 billion; Gross Private Product was
$99.3 billion. (See our calculations in the Appendix.) Total
Federal depredations on the private product equaled Federal
receipts, which were $5.2 billion. (Federal expenditures were a bit
lower at $4 billion.) State and Local depredations were $9 billion,
the figure for expenditures, receipts being estimated at $8.8 billion.
Total government depredations on the private product in
1929 were, therefore, $14.2 billion, a burden of 14.3 percent of the
gross private product (or, if we wish, 15.7 percent of the Net Private
Product). In 1930, GNP fell to $91.1 billion and GPP to
$85.8 billion. Federal expenditures rose to $4.2 billion, while
receipts fell to $4.4 billion; state and local expenditures rose to
$9.7 billion, and state and local receipts to $9.1 billion. Total
government depredations in 1930, therefore, remained about level at
$14.1 billion. But this now constituted 16.4 percent of the Gross
Private Product, and 18.2 percent of the net private product. The
fiscal burden of government had substantially <i> increased</i>
when it
should have been lowered. </p>



<p>Given any particular tax rates,
we would expect revenue to fall
in a depression, as national income fell, if government simply
remained passive. Government&rsquo;s particular responsibility,
then, is
to reduce its expenditures. Instead, expenditures rose by $800 million.
Of this, $700 million came from state and local governments
(the major categories: $170 million increase in salaries to employees;
$300 million increase in construction spending). The Federal
government increased its expenditure by $130 million, of which
$50 million was new construction. The Hoover policy of stimulating
public works was already taking effect.<sup><a href="#Note-9-22">22</a></sup></p>




<p>During 1929, the Federal
government had a huge surplus of
$1.2 billion ($4.1 billion receipts, $2.9 billion expenditures
excluding government enterprises; an estimated $5.2 billion receipts
and
$4.1 billion expenditures including government enterprises), and it
is to the Hoover administration&rsquo;s credit that as soon as the
depression struck, Hoover and Mellon suggested that the top normal
personal income tax rate be cut from 5 percent to 4 percent, and
the corporate income tax be reduced from 12 percent to 11 percent.<sup><a href="#Note-9-23">23</a></sup>
This suggestion was speedily enacted by Congress at the
end of 1929. As a partial consequence, Federal receipts fell to $4.4
billion in 1930 (or $3.3 billion excluding government enterprises).
Federal expenditures, in the meanwhile, rose to $4.2 billion ($3.1
billion excluding government enterprises), still leaving a considerable
surplus. The Federal fiscal burden on the private product
remained approximately the same, falling from 5.2 percent to 5.1
percent of gross private product, and from 5.8 to 5.7 percent of net
