	Part of the pressure for this attack on the meat packers came from
	wholesale
	grocers, who raised the familiar cry of &ldquo;unfair

	President Wilson had suspended and then vainly vetoed renewal of the
	WFC
	at the behest of Secretary of Treasury David Houston, who was opposed
	in principle to any continuation of war intervention in the peacetime
	economy. Even
	after Congress overrode the veto, Houston was able to keep a checkrein
	on WFC
	activities. When Harding became President, he reappointed Eugene Meyer
	as
	head of the WFC and, under Meyer&rsquo;s inspiration, supported the
	subsequent
	expansion. See Gerald D. Nash, &ldquo;Herbert Hoover and the
	Origins of the RFC,&rdquo;

	It may surprise many to learn that much of the cartel agitation came
	not
	from cotton farmers. It came from the merchants and bankers with large
	inventories of cotton on hand, and who would not suffer from reductions
	in acreage.

	The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation resolved in January, 1922 to present

	lobbyist for the farm bloc,

	By 1924, in addition to Peek, Johnson, the two Henry

	there were the Illinois
	Agricultural Association, most Western farm journals, the American Farm

	Behind the scenes, Bernard Baruch had also been advocating a Federal
	Farm Board to raise farm prices by organizing agriculture under
	government
	aegis, starting with wheat and cotton. He was also active in urging
	Commerce and
	the National Industrial Conference Board, Commission on Agriculture,
	jointly
	established by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Industrial
	Conference Board. The Commission was sure that <i>&ldquo;</i>laissez-faire
	is of the past.&rdquo;

	E. Robinson, &ldquo;The Hoover
	Leadership, 1929&ndash;1933&rdquo; (unpublished manuscript),
	pp. 128ff. After the first year
	of operations, Legge retired and Stone became chairman. Teague and
	McKelvie
	were replaced by two former high officials in the American Farm Bureau
	Federation, Frank Evans and the aggressive Sam H. Thompson. </a></p>

	This was to become a permanent question for logical people, with no
	sign
	yet that anyone is willing to answer. From the point of view of the
	general public, of course, the policies are contradictory and
	irrational. From the point of view
	of the government bureaucracy, however, both measures add to its power
	and
	swell its number. </a></p>

	To their great credit, some organizations bitterly opposed the FFB
	throughout these years. These included the Nebraska Farmers&rsquo;

	At the end of 1931, Secretary of Agriculture Hyde was advocating the

	purchase and reforestation of submarginal lands. &ldquo;Hyde,

	There were also &ldquo;milk strikes&rdquo; in some areas, with
	milk trucks seized on the
	roads, and their contents dumped upon the ground. Wisconsin and
	California, in
	1932, pioneered in setting up state milk controls, amounting to
	compulsory milk
	cartellization on a state-wide level. See Benedict and Stine, <i>The
