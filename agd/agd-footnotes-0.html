	The depression of 1873&ndash;1879 was a special case. It was, in
	the first place, a
	mild recession, and second, it was largely a price decline generated by
	the monetary contraction attending return to the pre-Civil War gold
	standard. On the
	mildness of this depression, particularly in manufacturing, see O.V.
	Wells, &ldquo;The
	Depression of 1873&ndash;79,&rdquo; <i>Agricultural
	History </i>11 (1937): 240.</font></p></a>

	Even taken by itself, the &ldquo;contraction&rdquo; phase of
	the depression, from
	1929&ndash;1933, was unusually long and unusually severe,
	particularly in its degree of
	unemployment.</font></p></a>

	It must be emphasized that Ludwig von Mises is in no way responsible
	for
	any of the contents of this book.</font></p></a>



	<a name="Note-0-4"><p><font size="-1"><sup>4</sup>This
	is by no means
	to deny that the ultimate
	premises of economic theory,
	e.g., the fundamental axiom of action, or the variety of resources, are
	derived
	from experienced reality. Economic theory, however, is <i>a
	priori</i> to all other historical facts. </font></p></a>



	<a name="Note-0-5"><p><font size="-1"><sup>5</sup>
	This &ldquo;praxeological&rdquo; methodology runs counter to
	prevailing views.
	Exposition of this approach, along with references to the literature,
	may be found
	in Murray N. Rothbard, &ldquo;In Defense of &lsquo;Extreme <i>A
	Priorism</i>&rsquo;,&rdquo; <i>Southern Economic
	Journal</i> (January, 1957): 214&ndash;20; idem,
	&ldquo;Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller,&rdquo;
	<i>American Economic Review </i>(December, 1951):
	943&ndash;46; and idem, &ldquo;Toward A
	Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics,&rdquo; in Mary
	Sennholz, ed., <i>On
	Freedom and Free Enterprise </i>(Princeton, N.J.: D. Van
	Nostrand, 1956), pp. 224&ndash;62.
	The major methodological works of this school are: Ludwig von Mises, <i>Human
	Action </i>(New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1949);
	Mises, <i>Theory and
	History </i>(New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1957);
	F.A. Hayek, <i> The
	Counterrevolution of Science </i>(Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press,
	1952); Lionel Robbins,
	<i>The Nature and Significance of Economic Science </i>(London:
	Macmillan, 1935), Mises,
	<i>Epistemological Problems of Economics </i>(Princeton,
	N.J.: D. Van Nostrand, 1960);
	and Mises, <i>The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science </i>(Princeton,
	N.J.: D. Van
	Nostrand, 1962).&nbsp;</font></p></a>

	Similarly, if the economy had recovered, the advocates would claim
	success
	for the theory, while critics would assert that recovery came <i>despite
	</i>the baleful
	influence of governmental policy, and more painfully and slowly than
	would otherwise have been the case. How should we decide between them?</font></p></a>

	The only really valuable studies of the 1929 depression are: Lionel
	Robbins,
	<i>The Great
	Depression </i>(New
	York: Macmillan, 1934),
	which deals with the United
	States only briefly; C.A. Phillips, T.F. McManus, and R.W. Nelson, <i>Banking
	and
	the Business Cycle </i>(New
	York: Macmillan, 1937); and Benjamin
	M. Anderson,
	<i>Economics and
	the Public Welfare </i>(New
	York: D. Van
	Nostrand, 1949), which does
	not deal solely with the depression, but covers twentieth-century
	economic history. Otherwise, Thomas Wilson&rsquo;s drastically
	overrated <i>Fluctuations
	in Income and
	Employment </i>(3rd
	ed., New York: Pitman, 1948) provides almost
	the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
	interpretation of the depression, and recently we have been confronted
	with John
	K. Galbraith&rsquo;s slick, superficial narrative of the pre-crash
	stock market, <i>The
	Great
	Crash, 1929 </i>(Boston:
	Houghton Mifflin, 1955). This, aside
	from very brief and
	unilluminating treatments by Slichter, Schumpeter, and Gordon is just
	about all.
	There are many tangential discussions, especially of the alleged
	&ldquo;mature economy&rdquo; of the later 1930s. Also see, on
	the depression and the Federal Reserve
	System, the recent brief article of O.K. Burrell, &ldquo;The Coming
	Crisis in External
	Convertibility in U.S. Gold,&rdquo; <i>Commercial
	and
	Financial Chronicle </i>(April
	23, 1959):
	5, 52&ndash;53.</font></p></a>
