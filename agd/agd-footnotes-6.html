<h3>Chapter 6</h3>



	<p><a name="Note-6-1"><sup>1</sup>The qualitative aspect of credit is important to the extent that bank
	loans
	must be to <i>business, </i>and not to government or to
	consumers, to put the trade cycle
	mechanism into motion. </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-2"><sup>2</sup>The National Industrial Conference Board (NICB) consumer price index
	rose
	from 102.3 (1923 = 100) in 1921 to 104.3 in 1926, then fell to 100.1 in
	1929; the
	Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) consumer good index fell from 127.7
	(1935&ndash;1939 =
	100) in 1921 to 122.5 in 1929. <i>Historical Statistics of the
	U.S., 1789&ndash;1945</i> (Washington,
	D.C.: U.S. Department of Commerce, 1949), pp. 226&ndash;36, 344. </a></p>

	Business
	Cycle </i>(New York: Macmillan, 1937), pp. 176ff. </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-4"><sup>4</sup>Lester V. Chandler, <i>Benjamin Strong,
	Central Banker </i>(Washington, D.C.:
	Brookings Institution, 1958), p. 312. In this view, Strong was, of
	course, warmly
	supported by Montagu Norman. Ibid., p. 315. </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-5"><sup>5</sup>Also see ibid., pp. 199ff. And Charles Rist
	recalls that, in his private conversations, &ldquo;Strong was
	convinced that he was able to fix the price level, by his interest and
	credit policy.&rdquo; Charles Rist, &ldquo;Notice
	Biographique,&rdquo;<i>Revue d&rsquo;&Egrave;conomie
	Politique </i>(November&ndash;December, 1955): 1029. </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-6"><sup>6</sup>Strong thus overcame his previous marked
	skepticism toward any legislative
	mandate for price stabilization. Before this, he had preferred to leave
	the matter
	strictly to Fed discretion. See Chandler, <i>Benjamin Strong,
	Central Banker, </i>pp. 202ff. </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-7"><sup>7</sup>See the account in Irving Fisher, ibid., pp. 170&ndash;71. Commons
	wrote of
	Governor Strong: &ldquo;I admired him both for his open-minded help
	to us on the bill
	and his reservation that he must go along with his
	associates.&rdquo; </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-8"><sup>8</sup>See Fisher&rsquo;s eulogy of Snyder, <i>Stabilised Money</i>,
	pp. 64&ndash;67; and Carl Snyder,

	Economic Review </i>(June, 1923):

	<p><a name="Note-6-12"><sup>12</sup>Leading stabilizationist Norman Lombard also
	hailed Strong&rsquo;s alleged
	achievement: &ldquo;By applying the principles expounded in this
	book . . . he [Strong]
	maintained in the United States a fairly stable price level and a
	consequent condition of widespread economic well-being from 1922 to
	1928.&rdquo; Norman
	Lombard, <i>Monetary Statesmanship </i>(New York:
	Harpers, 1934), p. 32n. On the
	influence of stable price ideas on Federal Reserve policy, see also

	Friedman, &ldquo;Study of Price Theories Behind Federal Reserve
	Credit Policy,
	1921&ndash;29&rdquo; (unpublished M.A. thesis, Columbia
	University, 1938). </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-13"><sup>13</sup>Fisher, <i>Stabilised Money, </i>p. 282. Our account of
	the growth of the stable
	money movement rests heavily upon Fisher&rsquo;s work. </a></p>



	<p><a name="Note-6-14"><sup>14</sup>While Hawtrey was the main inspiration for the
	resolutions, he criticized
	them for not going far enough. </a></p>
