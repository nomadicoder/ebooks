	The New York Federal Reserve also continued to lead in collaborating
	with
	foreign central banks, often against the wishes of the administration.
	Thus, the
	Bank of International Settlements, an attempt at an inter-central
	banks&rsquo; central
	bank, instigated by Montagu Norman, treated the New York Bank as
	America&rsquo;s central bank. Chairman of the BIS&rsquo;s first
	organizing committee was Jackson E.
	Reynolds, a director of the New York Federal Reserve, and its first
	president was
	Gates W. McGarrah, who resigned as Governor of the New York Reserve
	Bank in
	February, 1930, to assume the post. J.P. Morgan and Company supplied
	much of the
	American capital in the new Bank. In November, Governor Harrison made a
	&ldquo;regular business trip&rdquo; abroad to confer with other
	central bankers, and discuss loans to
	foreign governments. In 1931, the New York Federal Reserve extended
	loans to the
	BIS. Yet there was no legislative sanction for our participation in the
	Bank. </a></p>

	Hoover&rsquo;s interest in governmental dams by no means began with
	the
	depression, as witness his proud launching of the Boulder Dam in
	December,
	1928. That private business is not always a reliable champion of free
	private
	enterprise, is shown by the approval of the dam by such utility
	companies as the
	Southern California Edison Company, which hoped to benefit by
	purchasing
	cheap, subsidized government power. In addition, private power
	companies saw
	Boulder Dam as a risky, submarginal project plagued by grave
	engineering difficulties, and were content to have the taxpayers assume
	the risk. </a></p>



	<p>On the other hand, it must be admitted that Hoover staunchly
	resisted
	Congressional attempts during 1931 and 1932 to launch into socialized
	electric
	power production and distribution at Muscle Shoals, a project strongly
	opposed by
	private power companies and later enlarged by the New Deal into the
	Tennessee
	Valley Authority (TVA). See Harris Gaylord Warren, <i>Herbert
	Hoover and the Great

	Generally, government expenditures are compared with Gross National
	Product (GNP) in weighing the fiscal extent of government activity in
	the economy. But since government expenditure is more depredation than
	production, it
	is first necessary to deduct &ldquo;product originating in
	government and in government enterprises&rdquo; from GNP to arrive
	at Gross Private Product. It might be
	thought that total government expenditures should not be deducted from
	GPP,
	because this involves double counting of government expenditures on
	bureaucrats&rsquo; salaries (&ldquo;product originating in
	government&rdquo;). But this is not double
	counting, for the great bulk of money spent on bureaucratic salaries is
	gathered
	by means of taxation of the <i>private </i>sector, and,
	therefore, it too involves depredation upon the private economy. Our
	method involves a slight amount of overcounting of depredation,
	however, insofar as funds for government spending
	come from taxation of the <i>bureaucrats </i>themselves,
	and are therefore not deducted
	from private product. This amount, particularly in the
	1929&ndash;1932 period, may
	safely be ignored, however, as there is no accurate way of estimating
	it and no better way of estimating government depredation on the
	private sector. </p>



	<p>If government expenditures and receipts are just balanced,
	then obviously
	each is a measure of depredation, as funds are acquired by taxation and
	channelled
	into expenditures. If expenditures are larger, then the deficit is
	either financed by
	issuing new money or by borrowing private savings. In either case, the
	deficit
	constitutes a drain of resources from the private sector. If there is a
	surplus of
	receipts over expenditures then the surplus taxes are drains on the
	private sector.
	For a more extended discussion, and a tabulation of estimates of these
	figures for
	the 1929&ndash;1932 period, see the Appendix. </a></p>

	While the data in the Appendix below list the rise in Federal
