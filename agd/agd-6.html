<font size="+2"><b>O</b></font>ne of the reasons that most
economists of the 1920s did
not recognize the existence of an inflationary problem was
the widespread adoption of a stable price level as the goal
and criterion for monetary
policy. The extent to which the Federal
Reserve authorities were guided by a desire to keep the price level
stable has been a matter of considerable controversy. Far less
controversial is the fact that more and more economists came to
consider a stable price level as the major goal of monetary policy. The
fact that general prices were more or less stable during the 1920s
told most economists that there was no inflationary threat, and
therefore the events of the great depression caught them completely
unaware. </p>



<p>Actually, bank credit expansion
creates its mischievous effects
by distorting price relations and by raising and altering prices
compared to what they would have been without the expansion.
Statistically, therefore, we can only identify the increase in money
supply, a simple fact. We cannot prove inflation by pointing to
price increases. We can only approximate explanations of complex
price movements by engaging in a comprehensive economic history of an
era&mdash;a task which is beyond the scope of this study. Suffice
it to say here that the stability of wholesale prices in the 1920s
was the result of monetary inflation offset by increased productivity,
which lowered costs of production and increased the supply of
goods. But this
&ldquo;offset&rdquo; was only <i>statistical</i>;
it did not eliminate the
boom&ndash;bust cycle, it only <i>obscured</i> it. The
economists who emphasized the importance of a stable price level were
thus especially
deceived, for they should have concentrated on what was happening to
the supply of money. Consequently, the economists who
raised an alarm over inflation in the 1920s were largely the
qualitativists. They were written off as hopelessly old-fashioned by
the
&ldquo;newer&rdquo; economists who realized the overriding
importance of the
quantitative in monetary affairs. The trouble did not lie with
particular credit on particular markets (such as stock or real estate);
the boom in the stock and real estate markets reflected
Mises&rsquo;s
trade cycle: a disproportionate boom in the prices of titles to capital
goods, <i>caused</i> by the increase in money supply
attendant upon
bank credit expansion.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">1</a></sup></p>



<p>The stability of the price level
in the 1920s is demonstrated by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics Index of Wholesale Prices, which
fell to 93.4 (100 = 1926) in June 1921, rose slightly to a peak of
104.5 in November 1925, and then fell back to 95.2 by June 1929.
The price level, in short, rose slightly until 1925 and fell slightly
thereafter. Consumer price indices also behaved in a similar manner.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">2</a></sup>
On the other hand, the Snyder Index of the General Price
Level, which includes all types of prices (real estate, stocks, rents,
and wage rates, as well as wholesale prices) rose considerably during
the period, from 158 in 1922 (1913 = 100) to 179 in 1929, a rise
of 13 percent. Stability was therefore achieved only in consumer
and wholesale prices, but these were and still are the fields
considered especially important by most economic writers. </p>




<p>Within the overall aggregate of
wholesale prices, foods and
farm products rose over the period while metals, fuel, chemicals,
and home furnishings fell considerably. That the boom was largely
felt in the <i>capital goods industries</i> can be seen by
(a) the quadrupling
of stock prices over the period, and by (b) the fact that durable goods
and iron and steel production each increased by about 160 percent,
while the production of non-durable goods (largely consumer
goods) increased by only 60 percent. In fact, production of such
consumer items as manufactured foods and textile products
increased by only 48 percent and 36 percent respectively, from
1921 to 1929. Another illustration of Mises&rsquo;s theory was that
wages
were bid up far more in the capital goods industries. Overbidding
of wage rates and other costs is a distinctive feature of
Mises&rsquo;s
analysis of capital goods industries in the boom. Average hourly
earnings, according to the Conference Board Index, rose in
selected manufacturing industries from $.52 in July 1921 to $.59 in
1929, a 12 percent increase. Among this group, wage rates in consumer
goods&rsquo; industries such as boots and shoes remained constant;
they rose 6 percent in furniture, less than 3 percent in meat
packing, and 8 percent in hardware manufacturing. On the other
hand, in such capital goods&rsquo; industries as machines and
machine
tools, wage rates rose by 12 percent, and by 19 percent in lumber,
22 percent in chemicals, and 25 percent in iron and steel. </p>



<p>Federal Reserve credit expansion,
then, whether so intended or
not, managed to keep the price level stable in the face of an
increased productivity that would, in a free and unhampered market,
have led to falling prices and a spread of increased living standards
to everyone in the population. The inflation distorted the
production structure and led to the ensuing
depression&ndash;adjustment period. It also prevented the whole
populace from enjoying
the fruits of progress in lower prices and insured that only those
enjoying higher monetary wages and incomes could benefit from
the increased productivity. </p>



<p>There is much evidence for the
charge of Phillips, McManus,
and Nelson that &ldquo;the end-result of what was probably the
greatest
price-level stabilization experiment in history proved to be, simply,
the greatest depression.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-6-">3</a></sup> Benjamin
Strong was apparently converted
to a stable-price-level philosophy during 1922. On January 11, 1925,
Strong privately wrote: </p>



<p>that it was my belief, and I
thought it was shared by all
others in the Federal Reserve System, that our whole
policy in the future, as in the past, would be directed
toward the stability of prices so far as it was possible for
us to influence prices.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">4</a></sup></p>



<p>When asked, in the Stabilization
Hearings of 1927, whether the
Federal Reserve Board could &ldquo;stabilize the price level to a
greater
extent&rdquo; than in the past, by open-market operations and other
control devices, Governor Strong answered, </p>



<p>I personally think that the
administration of the Federal
Reserve System since the reaction of 1921 has been just
as nearly directed as reasonable human wisdom could
direct it toward that very object.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">5</a></sup></p>



<p>It appears that Governor Strong
had a major hand, in early
1928, in drafting the bill by Representative James G. Strong of
Kansas (no relation) to compel the Federal Reserve System to promote a
stable price level.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">6</a></sup> Governor Strong was ill by
this time and
out of control of the System, but he wrote the final draft of the bill
along with Representative Strong. In the company of the Congressman and
Professor John R. Commons, one of the leading theoreticians of a stable
price level, Strong discussed the bill with
members of the Federal Reserve Board. When the Board disapproved,
Strong felt bound, in his public statements, to go along
with them.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">7</a></sup> We must further note that Carl
Snyder, a loyal and
almost worshipful follower of Governor Strong, and head of the
Statistical Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
was a leading advocate of monetary and credit control by the Federal
Reserve to stabilize the price level.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">8</a></sup></p>



<p>Certainly, the leading British
economists of the day firmly
believed that the Federal Reserve was deliberately and successfully
stabilizing the price level. John Maynard Keynes hailed &ldquo;the
successful management of the dollar by the Federal Reserve Board
from 1923 to 1928&rdquo; as a &ldquo;triumph&rdquo; for
currency management.
D.H. Robertson concluded in 1929 that &ldquo;a monetary policy
consciously aimed at keeping the general price level approximately
stable . . . has apparently been followed with some success by the
Federal Reserve Board in the United States since 1922.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-6-">9</a></sup>
Whereas
Keynes continued to hail the Reserve&rsquo;s policy a few years
after the
depression began, Robertson became critical, </p>



<p>Looking back . . . the great
American &ldquo;stabilization&rdquo; of
1922&ndash;1929 was really a vast attempt to destabilize the
value of money in terms of human effort by means of a
colossal program of investment . . . which succeeded for
a surprisingly long period, but which no human ingenuity could have
managed to direct indefinitely on sound
and balanced lines.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">10</a></sup></p>



<p>The siren song of a stable price
level had lured leading politicians, to say nothing of economists, as
early as 1911. It was then
that Professor Irving Fisher launched his career as head of the
&ldquo;stable money&rdquo; movement in the United States. He
quickly gained the
adherence of leading statesmen and economists to a plan for an
international commission to study the money and price problem.
Supporters included President William Howard Taft, Secretary of
War Henry Stimson, Secretary of Treasury Franklin MacVeagh,
Governor Woodrow Wilson, Gifford Pinchot, seven Senators, and
economists Alfred Marshall, Francis Edgeworth, and John Maynard Keynes
in England. President Taft sent a special message to
Congress in February, 1912, urging an appropriation for such an
international conference. The message was written by Fisher, in
collaboration with Assistant Secretary of State Huntington Wilson, a
convert to stable money. The Senate passed the bill, but it
died in the House. Woodrow Wilson expressed interest in the plan
but dropped the idea in the press of other matters. </p>



<p>In the spring of 1918, a
Committee on the Purchasing Power
of Money of the American Economic Association endorsed the
principle of stabilization. Though encountering banker opposition
to his stable-money doctrine, led notably by A. Barton Hepburn of
the Chase National Bank, Fisher began organizing the Stable
Money League at the end of 1920, and established the League at
the end of May, 1921&mdash;at the beginning of our inflationary
era.
Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War under Wilson, and Professor
James Harvey Rogers of Cornell were two of the early organizers.
Other prominent politicians and economists who played leading
roles in the Stable Money League were Professor Jeremiah W.
Jenks, its first president; Henry A. Wallace, editor of <i>
Wallace&rsquo;s
Farmer</i>, and later Secretary of Agriculture; John G. Winant,
later
Governor of New Hampshire; Professor John R. Commons, its
second President; George Eastman of the Eastman&ndash;Kodak family;
Lyman J. Gage, formerly Secretary of the Treasury; Samuel Gompers,
President of the American Federation of Labor; Senator
Carter Glass of Virginia; Thomas R. Marshall, Vice-President of
the United States under Wilson; Representative Oscar W. Underwood;
Malcolm C. Rorty; and economists Arthur Twining Hadley,
Leonard P. Ayres, William T. Foster, David Friday, Edwin W.
Kemmerer, Wesley C. Mitchell, Warren M. Persons, H. Parker
Willis, Allyn A. Young, and Carl Snyder. </p>



<p>The ideal of a stable price level
is relatively innocuous during a
price rise when it can aid sound money advocates in trying to check
the boom; but it is highly mischievous when prices are tending to
sag, and the stabilizationists call for inflation. And yet,
stabilization
is always a more popular rallying cry when prices are falling. The
Stable Money League was founded in 1920&ndash;1921, when prices
were falling during a depression. Soon, prices began to rise, and
some conservatives began to see in the stable money movement a
useful check against extreme inflationists. As a result, the League
changed its name to the National Monetary Association in 1923,
and its officers continued as before, with Professor Commons as
President. By 1925, the price level had reached its peak and begun
to sag, and consequently the conservatives abandoned their support of
the organization, which again changed its name to the Stable Money
Association. Successive presidents of the new association were H.
Parker Willis, John E. Rovensky, Executive VicePresident of the Bank of
America, Professor Kemmerer, and
&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; Frederic W. Delano. Other eminent leaders
in the Stable
Money Association were Professor Willford I. King; President
Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University; John W. Davis,
Democratic candidate for president in 1924; Charles G. Dawes,
Director of the Bureau of the Budget under Harding, and VicePresident
under Coolidge; William Green, President of the American Federation of
Labor; Charles Evans Hughes, Secretary of State
until 1925; Otto H. Kahn, investment banker; Frank O. Lowden,
former Republican Governor of Illinois; Elihu Root, former Secretary of
State and Senator; James H. Rand, Jr.; Norman Thomas, of
the Socialist Party; Paul M. Warburg and Owen D. Young. Enlisting from
abroad came Charles Rist of the Bank of France; Eduard
Benes of Czechoslovakia, Max Lazard of France; Emile Moreau of
the Bank of France; Louis Rothschild of Austria; and Sir Arthur
Balfour, Sir Henry Strakosch, Lord Melchett, and Sir Josiah Stamp
of Great Britain. Serving as honorary vice-presidents of the
Association were the Presidents of the following organizations: the
American Association for Labor Legislation, American Bar Association,
American Farm Bureau Federation, American Farm Economic
Association, American Statistical Association, Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen, National Association of Credit Men, National
Consumers&rsquo; League, National Education Association, American
Council on Education, United Mine Workers of America, the National
Grange, the Chicago Association of Commerce, the Merchants&rsquo;
Association of New York, and Bankers&rsquo; Associations in 43
states and
the District of Columbia. </p>



<p>Executive director and operating
head of the Association with
such formidable backing was Norman Lombard, brought in by
Fisher in 1926. The Association spread its gospel far and wide. It
was helped by the publicity given to Thomas Edison and Henry
Ford&rsquo;s proposal for a &ldquo;commodity dollar&rdquo;
in 1922 and 1923. Other
prominent stabilizationists in this period were professors George F.
Warren and Frank Pearson of Cornell, Royal Meeker, Hudson B.
Hastings, Alvin Hansen, and Lionel D. Edie. In Europe, in addition to
the above mentioned, advocates of stable money included:
Professor Arthur C. Pigou, Ralph G. Hawtrey, J.R. Bellerby, R.A.
Lehfeldt, G.M. Lewis, Sir Arthur Salter, Knut Wicksell, Gustav
Cassel, Arthur Kitson, Sir Frederick Soddy, F.W. PethickLawrence,
Reginald McKenna, Sir Basil Blackett, and John Maynard Keynes. Keynes
was particularly influential in his propaganda
for a &ldquo;managed currency&rdquo; and a stabilized price
level, as set forth
in his <i>A Tract on Monetary Reform</i>, published in
1923. </p>



<p>Ralph Hawtrey proved to be one of
the evil geniuses of the
1920s. An influential economist in a land where economists have
shaped policy far more influentially than in the United States,
Hawtrey, Director of Financial Studies at the British Treasury,
advocated international credit control by Central Banks to achieve
a stable price level as early as 1913. In 1919, Hawtrey was one of
the first to call for the adoption of a gold-exchange standard by
European countries, tying it in with international Central Bank
cooperation. Hawtrey was one of the prime European trumpeters
of the prowess of Governor Benjamin Strong. Writing in 1932, at
a time when Robertson had come to realize the evils of stabilization,
Hawtrey declared: &ldquo;The American experiment in stabilization
from 1922 to 1928 showed that an early treatment could check a
tendency either to inflation or to depression. . . . The American
experiment was a great advance upon the practice of the nineteenth
century,&rdquo; when the trade cycle was accepted passively.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">11</a></sup>
When Governor Strong died, Hawtrey called the event &ldquo;a
disaster
for the world.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-6-">12</a></sup> Finally, Hawtrey was
the main inspiration for the
stabilization resolutions of the Genoa Conference of 1922. </p>



<p>It was inevitable that this host
of fashionable opinion should be
translated into legislative pressure, if not legislative action. Rep.
T. Alan Goldsborough of Maryland introduced a bill to
&ldquo;Stabilize
the Purchasing Power of Money&rdquo; in May, 1922, essentially
Professor Fisher&rsquo;s proposal, fed to Goldsborough by former
VicePresident Marshall. Witnesses for the bill were Professors Fisher,
Rogers, King, and Kemmerer, but the bill was not reported out of
committee. In early 1924, Goldsborough tried again, and Rep.
O.B. Burtness of North Dakota introduced another stabilization
bill. Neither was reported out of committee. The next major effort
was a bill by Rep. James G. Strong of Kansas, introduced in January,
1926, under the urging of veteran stabilizationist George H.
Shibley, who had been promoting the cause of stable prices since
1896. Rather than the earlier Fisher proposal for a
&ldquo;compensated
dollar&rdquo; to manipulate the price level, the Strong Bill would
have
compelled the Federal Reserve System to act directly to stabilize the
price level. Hearings were held from March 1926 until February
1927. Testifying for the bill were Shibley, Fisher, Lombard, Dr.
William T. Foster, Rogers, Bellerby, and Commons. Commons, Rep.
Strong, and Governor Strong then rewrote the bill, as indicated
above, and hearings were held on the second Strong Bill in the
spring of 1928. </p>



<p>The high point of testimony for
the second Strong Bill was that
of Sweden&rsquo;s Professor Gustav Cassel, whose eminence packed
the
Congressional hearing room. Cassel had been promoting stabilization
since 1903. The advice of this sage was that the government employ
neither qualitative nor quantitative measures to
check the boom, since these would lower the general price level. In
a series of American lectures, Cassel also urged lower Fed reserve
ratios, as well as world-wide central bank cooperation to stabilize
the price level. </p>



<p>The Strong Bill met the fate of
its predecessors, and never left
the committee. But the pressure exerted at the various hearings for
these bills, as well as the weight of opinion and the views of Governor
Strong, served to push the Federal Reserve authorities into
trying to manipulate credit for purposes of price stabilization. </p>



<p>International pressure
strengthened the drive for a stable price
level. Official action began with the Genoa Conference, in the
spring of 1922. This Conference was called by the League of
Nations, at the initiative of Premier Lloyd George, who in turn
was inspired by the dominant figure of Montagu Norman. The
Financial Commission of the Conference adopted a set of resolutions
which, as Fisher puts it, &ldquo;have for years served as the
potent
armory for the advocates of stable money all over the world.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-6-">13</a></sup>
The resolutions urged international central bank collaboration to
stabilize the world price level, and also suggested a gold -exchange
standard. On the Financial Commission were such stabilizationist
stalwarts as Sir Basil Blackett, Professor Cassel, Dr. Vissering, and
Sir Henry Strakosch.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">14</a></sup> The League of Nations,
indeed, was
quickly taken over by the stabilizationists. The Financial Committee of
the League was largely inspired and run by Governor Montagu Norman,
working through two close associates, Sir Otto
Niemeyer and Sir Henry Strakosch. Sir Henry was, as we have
indicated, a prominent stabilizationist.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">15</a></sup>
Furthermore, Norman&rsquo;s
chief adviser in international affairs, Sir Charles S. Addis, was also
an ardent stablizationist.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">16</a></sup></p>



<p>In 1921, a Joint Committee on
Economic Crises was formed by
the General Labour Conference, the International Labour Office
(I.L.O.) of the League of Nations, and the Financial Committee of
the League. On this Joint Committee were three leading
stabilizationists: Albert Thomas, Henri Fuss, and Major J.R. Bellerby.
In
1923, Thomas&rsquo;s report warned that a fall in the price level
&ldquo;almost
invariably&rdquo; causes unemployment. Henri Fuss of the I.L.O.
propagandized for stable price levels in the <i>International
Labour Review</i>
in 1926. The Joint Committee met in June, 1925, to affirm the
principles of the Genoa Conference. In the meanwhile, two private
international organizations, the International Association for
Labour Legislation and the International Association on Unemployment,
held a joint International Congress on Social Policy, at
Prague, in October, 1924. The Congress called for the general
adoption of the principles of the Genoa Conference, by stabilizing
the general price level. The International Association for Social
Progress adopted a report at its Vienna meeting in September,
1928, prepared by stabilizationist Max Lazard of the investment
banking house of Lazard Fr&egrave;res in Paris, calling for price
level stability. The I.L.O. followed suit in June, 1929, terming
falling
prices a cause of unemployment. And, finally, the Economic Consultative
Committee of the League endorsed the Genoa principles
in the summer of 1928. </p>



<p>Just as Professors Cassel and
Commons wanted no credit
restraint at all in 1928 and 1929, so Representative Louis T.
McFadden, powerful chairman of the House Banking and Currency
Committee, exerted a similar though more powerful brand
of pressure on the Federal Reserve authorities. On February 7,
1929, the day after the Federal Reserve Board&rsquo;s letter to the
Federal
Reserve Banks warning about stock market speculation, Representative
McFadden himself warned the House against an adverse
business reaction from this move. He pointed out that there had
been no rise in the commodity price level, so how could there be
any danger of inflation? The Fed, he warned skittishly, should not
concern itself with the stock market or security loans, lest it produce
a general slump. Tighter money would make capital financing difficult,
and, coupled with the resulting loss of confidence,
would precipitate a depression. In fact, McFadden declared that
the Fed should be prepared to ease money rates as soon as any fall
in prices or employment might appear.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">17</a></sup> Other
influential voices
raised against any credit restriction were those of W.T. Foster and
Waddill Catchings, leading stabilizationists and well known for
their underconsumptionist theories. Catchings was a prominent
investment banker (of Goldman, Sachs and Co.), and iron and steel
magnate, and both men were close to the Hoover Administration.
(As we shall see, their &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for curing
unemployment was
adopted, at one time, by Hoover.) In April, 1929, Foster and
Catchings warned that any credit restriction would lower the price
level and hurt business. The bull market, they assured the
public&mdash;
along with Fisher, Commons, and the rest&mdash;was grounded on a
sure foundation of American confidence and growth.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">18</a></sup>
And the
bull speculators, of course, echoed the cry that everyone should
&ldquo;invest in America.&rdquo; Anyone who criticized the boom
was considered to be unpatriotic and &ldquo;selling America
short.&rdquo; </p>



<p>In an age of folly, Professor
Young&rsquo;s article was perhaps the
crowning <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>&mdash;much
more censurable than the superficially more glaring errors of such
economists as Irving Fisher and
Charles A. Dice on the alleged &ldquo;new era&rdquo; prosperity
of the stock
market. Merely to extrapolate present stock market conditions is,
after all, not nearly as reprehensible as considering deflation the
main threat in the midst of a rampantly inflationary era. But such
was the logical conclusion of the stabilizationist position. </p>



<p>We may conclude that the Federal
Reserve authorities, in
promulgating their inflationary policies, were motivated not only
by the desire to help British inflation and to subsidize farmers, but
were also guided&mdash;or rather misguided&mdash;by the
fashionable economic theory of a stable price level as the goal of
monetary manipulation.<sup><a href="#Note-6-">21</a></sup></p>
