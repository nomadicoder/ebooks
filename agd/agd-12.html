	<h3>The Close of the Hoover Term </h3>


	</div>



	<p><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>he fact that Hoover sought
	reelection in the midst of the
	deepest and worst depression in American history, and in
	the face of unprecedented unemployment did not lower
	his satisfaction as he looked back upon
	his record. After all, as he
	said in his acceptance speech for the Presidential renomination:
	
	<blockquote>[W]e might have done nothing.
	That would have been
	utter ruin. Instead, we met the situation with proposals
	to private business and to Congress of the most gigantic
	program of economic defense and counterattack ever
	evolved in the history of the Republic. We put it into
	action. </blockquote>



	No one could accuse him of being slack in
	inaugurating the vast
	interventionist program: 
	
	<blockquote>No government in Washington has
	hitherto considered
	that it held so broad a responsibility for leadership in
	such times. . . . For the first time in the history of
	depression, dividends, profits, and the cost of living have
	been reduced before wages have suffered.</blockquote>



	At St. Paul, at the end of his
	campaign, Hoover summarized the
	measures he had taken to combat the depression: higher tariffs,
	which had protected agriculture and prevented much unemployment,
	expansion of credit by the Federal Reserve, which Hoover
	somehow identified with &ldquo;protection of the gold
	standard&rdquo;; the Home
	Loan Bank system, providing long-term capital to building-and-loan
    <!--321-->
	associations and savings banks,
	and enabling them to expand credit
	and suspend foreclosures; agricultural credit banks which loaned to
	farmers; Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) loans to
	banks, states, agriculture, and public works; spreading of work to
	prevent unemployment; the extension of construction and public
	works; strengthening Federal Land Banks; and, especially, inducing
	employers to maintain wage rates. Wage rates &ldquo;were maintained
	until the cost of living had decreased and the profits had
	practically vanished. They are now the highest real wages in the
	world.&rdquo; But was there any causal link between this fact and
	the
	highest unemployment rate in American history? This question
	Hoover ignored. </p>



	<p>Hoover had, indeed,
	&ldquo;placed humanity before money, through
	the sacrifice of profits and dividends before wages,&rdquo; but
	people
	found it difficult to subsist or prosper on
	&ldquo;humanity.&rdquo; Hoover
	noted that he had made work for the unemployed, prevented foreclosures,
	saved banks, and &ldquo;fought to retard falling prices.&rdquo;
	It is
	true that &ldquo;for the first time&rdquo; Hoover had prevented
	an &ldquo;immediate
	attack upon wages as a basis of maintaining profits,&rdquo; but the
	result
	of wiping out profits and maintaining artificial wage rates was
	chronic, unprecedented depression. On the RFC, Hoover proclaimed, as he
	did for the rest of his program, &ldquo;Nothing has ever
	been devised in our history which has done more for those whom
	Mr. Coolidge has aptly called the &lsquo;common run of men and
	women.&rsquo;&rdquo; Yet, after three years of this benevolent
	care, the common man was worse off than ever. </p>



	<p>Hoover staunchly upheld a
	protective tariff during his campaign, and declared that his
	administration had successfully kept
	American farm prices above world prices, aided by tariffs on
	agricultural products. He did not seem to see that this price-raising
	reduced foreign demand for American farm products. He hailed
	work-sharing without seeing that it perpetuated unemployment,
	and spoke proudly of the artificial expansion by business of
	construction &ldquo;beyond present needs&rdquo; at his request
	in 1929&ndash;30, without seeing the resulting malinvestment and
	business losses. </p>



	<p>While claiming to defend the
	gold standard, Hoover greatly
	shook public confidence in the dollar and helped foster the ensuing
	monetary crisis by revealing in his opening campaign speech that
	the government had almost decided to go off the gold standard in
	the crisis of November, 1931&mdash;an assertion heatedly denied by
	conservative Democratic Senator Carter Glass. </p>



	<p>The spirit of the Hoover policy
	was perhaps best summed up in
	a public statement made in May, before the campaign began, when
	he sounded a note that was to become all too familiar to Americans
	in later years&mdash;the military metaphor:



	<blockquote>The battle to set our economic
	machine in motion in
	this emergency takes new forms and requires new tactics
	from time to time. We used such emergency powers to
	win the war; we can use them to fight the depression.</blockquote> </p>



	<p>Yet, if New Deal socialism was
	the logic of Hoover&rsquo;s policy, he
	cautiously extended the logic only so far. He warned at St. Paul of
	the strange and radical ideas prevalent in the Democratic Party:
	the schemes for currency tinkering, the pension bill, the commodity
	dollar, the pork-barrel bill, the plans for veterans&rsquo; bonuses
	and
	over $2 billion of greenback issue, make-work schemes, and an agitation
	for a vast $9 billion-a-year public works program. It was also
	to Hoover&rsquo;s credit that he resisted the pressure of Henry
	Harriman, who urged Hoover to adopt the Swope Plan for economic
	fascism during his campaign, a plan which was soon to bear fruit in
	the National Recovery Administration (NRA). </p>



	<center><h3>THE ATTACK ON PROPERTY RIGHTS:
	THE FINAL CURRENCY FAILURE</h3></center>

	<p>As in most depressions, the
	property rights of creditors in debts
	and claims were subjected to frequent attack, in favor of debtors
	who wished to refuse payment of their obligations with impunity.
	We have noted the Federal drive to weaken the bankruptcy laws.
	States also joined in the attack on creditors. Many states adopted
	compulsory debt moratoria in early 1933, and sales at auction for
	debt judgments were halted by Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota,
	Nebraska, and South Dakota. Governor Clyde Herring of Iowa
	asked insurance and mortgage companies to stop foreclosing mortgages.
	Life insurance companies protested that they were being very
	lenient, yet in many areas the courts would not enforce foreclosures
	for insurance companies, enabling many borrowers arrogantly to
	refuse to pay. Minnesota forbade foreclosures on farms or homes
	for several years.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-1">1</a></sup></font></p>



	<p>Most important of the attacks on
	creditors&rsquo; property occurred
	during the currency crisis that marked the end of the Hoover term.
	After the election, as the new Presidential term approached, people
	grew more and more apprehensive, and properly so, of the
	monetary policies of the incoming president. Dark rumors circulated
	about the radicalism of Roosevelt&rsquo;s advisers, and of their
	willingness to go off the gold standard. Consequently, not only did
	gold &ldquo;hoarding&rdquo; by foreigners develop momentum, but
	even gold
	hoarding by domestic citizens. For the first time in the depression,
	American citizens were beginning to lose confidence in the dollar
	itself. The loss of confidence reached its apogee in February, 1933,
	the month before the Roosevelt inaugural. In that one month, the
	monetary gold stock fell by $173 million, and money in circulation
	increased by the phenomenal amount of $900 million, the reflection of
	domestic loss of confidence. Money in circulation totaled
	$5.4 billion at the end of January, and $6.3 billion by the end of
	February. $700 million of this increase was in Federal Reserve
	notes, and $140 million in gold coin and gold certificates. </p>



	<p>The Federal Reserve did its best
	to combat this deflationary
	pull on bank reserves, but its inflationary measures only served to
	diminish confidence in the dollar still further. Thus, in the month
	of February alone, Uncontrolled Reserves fell by $1,089 million.
	The FRS greatly inflated its Controlled Reserves: bills discounted
	more than doubled to increase by $308 million, bills bought multiplied
	tenfold to increase by $305 million, $103 million of U.S.
	governments were purchased. All in all, controlled reserves
	increased by $785 million during this month; net reserves fell by
	$305 million. </p>



	<p>The impact of this fall on the
	money supply was very strong.
	Total currency and deposits fell from $45.4 billion at the end of
	1932 to $41.7 billion at mid-1933. Total money supply fell from
	$64.72 to $61.61 billion over 1933, and all or more of this fall took
	place in the first half of the year.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-2">2</a></sup></font> A more
	sensitive measure of
	change, net demand deposits and time deposits at weekly reporting
	member banks in 101 cities, totaled $16.8 billion on February 22,
	and fell to $14.1 billion by March 8. Bank failures skyrocketed during
	this period. The number of commercial bank failures increased
	from 1,453 in 1932 to 4,000 in 1933 (most of which took place in
	the first quarter), with deposits of failed banks increasing from
	$706 million to $3.6 billion in the same period.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-3">3</a></sup></font>
	Thus, despite the
	gigantic efforts of the Fed, during early 1933, to inflate the money
	supply, the people took matters into their own hands, and insisted
	upon a rigorous deflation (gauged by the increase of money in
	circulation)&mdash;and a rigorous testing of the
	country&rsquo;s banking system
	in which they had placed their trust. </p>
	
	
	
	<p>The reaction to this growing
	insistence of the people on claiming their rightful, legally-owned
	property, was a series of vigorous
	attacks on property right by state after state. One by one, states
	imposed &ldquo;bank holidays&rdquo; by fiat, thus permitting
	the banks to stay
	in business while refusing to pay virtually all of the just claims of
	their depositors (a pattern that had unfortunately become almost
	traditional in America since the Panic of 1819). Nevada had begun
	the parade as early as October, 1932, but only 9 out of 20 banks
	took advantage of the state holiday, the others remaining open.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-4">4</a></sup></font>
	Louisiana declared a brief holiday for the hard-pressed New
	Orleans banks in early February, but the bank holiday movement
	began in earnest with the proclamation of an eight-day holiday on
	February 14, 1933, by Governor William Comstock of Michigan.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-5">5</a></sup></font>
	This action precipitated the bank runs and deflation of the latter
	part of February. For if one state could, with impunity, destroy
	property right in this manner, then others could&mdash;and
	did&mdash;and
	depositors began an intense scramble to take their money out of
	the banks. </p>
	
	
	
	<p>It is at times like <i>these</i>that
	the speciousness of apologists for our
	banking system hailing fractional reserves as being as sound as the
	building of bridges&mdash;on estimate that only some inhabitants of
	the
	area will cross it at any one time&mdash;becomes patently evident.
	For
	no one has a legal property ownership in the bridge, as they do in
	their bank deposits. At times like these, also, it becomes clear that
	bank deposits are not really money&mdash;even on a paper, let alone
	a
	gold standard&mdash;but mere money<i>substitutes</i>,
	which serve as money
	ordinarily, but reveal their true identity when nationwide confidence
	begins to collapse. </p>



	<p>On the request of bankers for
	government to save them from
	the consequences of their own mistakes, state after state, beginning
	with Indiana, declared moratoria and bank holidays. Governor
	Ritchie of Maryland declared a three-day bank holiday on February 24.
	On February 27, the member banks of the Cleveland
	Clearing House Association decided arbitrarily to limit withdrawals
	from all their branches, and no state officials acted to stop
	this blatant infringement of property right. They were promptly
	followed by Akron and Indianapolis banks. On February 27, the
	Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Delaware legislatures authorized the state
	banking officials to restrict the right of withdrawal of deposits.
	The states adopted this procedure quickly and virtually without
	debate, the laws being rammed through on the old political excuse
	that the taxpaying and voting public must be kept in ignorance of
	the situation in order to prevent panic.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-6">6</a></sup></font> In
	such a manner do the
	&ldquo;people&rsquo;s representatives&rdquo;
	characteristically treat their supposed
	principals. </p>



	<p>One of the ironic aspects of
	this situation was the fact that many
	national banks, which had worked hard to keep themselves in an at
	least relatively sound position, did not want to avail themselves of
	the special privilege of bank holiday, and had to be coerced into
	doing so. As Willis puts it: 



	<blockquote>[i]n many cases, the national
	banks . . . had no wish to
	join in the holiday provisions of the localities in which
	they were situated. They had, in such cases, kept themselves in
	position to meet all claims to which they might
	be subject, and they desired naturally to demonstrate to
	depositors and customers their ability to meet and overcome the
	obstacles of the time, both as a service to such
	customers and as an evidence of their own trustworthiness. There
	followed what was deemed . . . the necessity
	or desirability of coercing . . . the sound banks of the
	community into acceptation of the standard thought
	essential for the less liquid and less well-managed institutions.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-7">7</a></sup></font></blockquote></p>



	<p>By March 4, every state in the
	Union had declared a bank holiday, and the stage was set for President
	Roosevelt&rsquo;s dramatic and
	illegal closing of all the banks. The stage was set, by the way, with
	the full collaboration of the outgoing administration; in late
	February, Congress, with the acquiescence of President Hoover,
	passed a law permitting national banks to cooperate with state
	bank holidays. And the Comptroller of the Currency obligingly
	issued a proposed draft of a uniform bank holiday act to aid the
	various state legislatures in drafting their bills. </p>



	<p>President Roosevelt closed down
	all the banks throughout the
	nation for an entire week, from March 6 to 13, with many banks
	remaining closed even longer.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-8">8</a></sup></font> It was a final
	stroke of irony that
	Roosevelt&rsquo;s only semblance of legal ground for this decree
	was the
	Trading with the Enemy Act of World War I! Restrictions against
	so-called &ldquo;hoarding&rdquo; were continued afterward, and
	much hoarded
	gold returned to the banks following a Federal Reserve threat to
	publish a list, for full public scorn, of the leading &ldquo;gold
	hoarders.&rdquo;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-9">9</a></sup></font>
	It soon became clear that, with the advent of the Roosevelt
	administration, the American gold standard was doomed. </p>



	<p>There have been a great many
	recriminations, particularly from
	the Hoover camp, about Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;failure to
	cooperate,&rdquo; when
	he was President-elect, in solving the banking crisis. Certainly it is
	true that fear of Roosevelt&rsquo;s impending monetary radicalism,
	and
	Senator Glass&rsquo;s investigations forcing Charles E. Mitchell to
	resign
	as President of the National City Bank, contributed to the banking
	panic. But the important fact is that the banking system had
	arrived at a critical impasse. Usually, in the placid course of events,
	radical (in the sense of far-reaching) economic reforms, whether
	needed or not, meet the resistance and inertia of those who drift
	with the daily tide. But here, in the crisis of 1933, the banks could
	no longer continue as they were. Something had to be done.
	Essentially, there were two possible routes. One was the course
	taken by Roosevelt; the destruction of the property rights of bank
	depositors, the confiscation of gold, the taking away of the
	people&rsquo;s
	monetary rights, and the placing of the Federal Government in
	control of a vast, managed, engine of inflation. The other route
	would have been to seize the opportunity to awaken the American
	people to the true nature of their banking system, and thereby
	return, at one swoop, to a truly hard and sound money. </p>



	<p>The laissez-faire method would
	have permitted the banks of the
	nation to close&mdash;as they probably would have done without
	governmental intervention. The bankrupt banks could then have been
	transferred to the ownership of their depositors, who would have
	taken charge of the invested, frozen assets of the banks. There
	would have been a vast, but rapid, deflation, with the money supply
	falling to virtually 100 percent of the nation&rsquo;s gold stock.
	The
	depositors would have been &ldquo;forced savers&rdquo; in the
	existing bank
	assets (loans and investments). This cleansing surgical operation
	would have ended, once and for all, the inherently bankrupt
	fractional-reserve system, would have henceforth grounded loans and
	investments on people&rsquo;s voluntary savings rather than
	artificiallyextended credit, and would have brought the country to a
	truly
	sound and hard monetary base. The threat of inflation and depression
	would have been permanently ended, and the stage fully set
	for recovery from the existing crisis. But such a policy would have
	been dismissed as &ldquo;impractical&rdquo; and radical, at the
	very juncture
	when the nation set itself firmly down the
	&ldquo;practical&rdquo; and radical
	road to inflation, socialism, and perpetuation of the depression for
	almost a decade. </p>



	<p>President Hoover, of course, did
	not even come close to advocating the hard money, laissez-faire policy.
	Hoover and his partisans have woven the myth that all would have been
	well if only
	Roosevelt had &ldquo;cooperated&rdquo; with Hoover before the
	inaugural, but
	just what was this projected cooperation to be? Largely, a joint
	agreement on partial or total national bank holidays, and on a
	Hoover proposal for temporary federal guarantees of bank
	deposits&mdash;inflationist and statist measures which Roosevelt
	was
	soon to adopt.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-10">10</a>, <a href="#Note-12-11">11</a></sup></font> Furthermore, as a <i>pi&egrave;ce
	de r&eacute;sistance</i>, agitation for
	going off the gold standard kept proceeding from high up in the
	Hoover administration itself; specifically from Secretary of Treasury
	Mills and from Undersecretary Arthur Ballantine.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-12">12</a></sup></font></p>



	<center><h3>WAGES, HOURS, AND EMPLOYMENT
	DURING THE DEPRESSION</h3></center>
	
	<p>Mr. Hoover left office in March,
	1933, at the very depth of the
	greatest depression in American history. Production had fallen by
	more than one-half: industrial production had been at an index of
	114 in August, 1929, and then fell to 54 by March, 1933. Unemployment
	was persisting at nearly 25 percent of the labor force,
	and gross national product had also fallen almost in half. Hardest
	hit was investment, especially business construction, the latter
	falling from about $8.7 billion in 1929 to $1.4 billion in 1933. This
	is not the only indication that the depression hit hardest in the
	capital goods industries. </p>



	<p>The index of <i>non-durable</i>
	manufacturing production fell from
	94 to 66 from August, 1929, to March, 1933&mdash;a decline of 30
	percent; the index of <i>durable</i> manufactures fell
	from 140 to 32, in the
	same period, a decline of 77 percent. Factory employment fell by
	42 percent; pig iron production decreased by an astounding 85
	percent; the value of construction contracts fell from July, 1929, by
	an amazing 90 percent, and the value of building permits by 94
	percent. On the other hand, department store sales fell by less than
	50 percent over the period. Taking durable goods industries (e.g.,
	building, roads, metals, iron and steel, lumber, railroad, etc.) Col.
	Leonard P. Ayres estimated that their total employment fell from 10
	million in 1929 to 4 million in 1932&ndash;1933, while employment
	in
	consumer goods industries (e.g., food, farming, textiles, electricity,
	fuel, etc.) only fell from 15 million to 13 million in the same
	period.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-13">13</a></sup></font> Stock prices (industrials) fell by 76
	percent during the
	depression, wholesale prices fell by 30 percent, and the total
	money supply declined by one-sixth. </p>



	<p>What of wage rates? We saw that
	the Hoover policies managed
	to keep wage rates very high during the first two years of the
	depression. By 1932, however, with profits wiped out, the pressure
	became too great, and wage rates fell considerably. Total fall over
	the 1929&ndash;1933 period, however, was only 23
	percent&mdash;less than
	the decline in wholesale prices. Therefore, real wage rates, for the
	workers still remaining employed, actually <i>increased</i>.
	An excellent
	inquiry into the wage-employment problem during the depression
	has been conducted by Mr. Sol Shaviro, in an unpublished essay.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-14">14</a></sup></font>
	Shaviro shows that in 25 leading manufacturing industries, the
	following was the record of monetary, and real, average hourly earnings
	during these years. </p>



	<p>We thus see that money wage
	rates held up almost to the prosperity-par until the latter half of
	1931, while real wage rates actually increased by over 10 percent. Only
	then did a monetary wage
	decline set in, but still without a very appreciable reduction in real
	wage rates from the 1931 peak. It should here be noted that, in
	contrast to Keynesian warnings, prices fell far less sharply after
	wage rates began to drop, than before. From July, 1929, to June,
	1931, wholesale prices fell from 96.5 to 72.1, or at a rate of fall of
	1 per month, while from June, 1931, to February, 1933, prices fell
	to 59.8, or at a rate of .65 per month.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-15">15</a></sup></font></p>

	<p>Shaviro points out that
	businessmen, particularly the large
	employers, were taken in by the doctrine that they should pursue
	an &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; high-wage policy, a doctrine not
	only fed to them
	by the veiled threats of the President, but also by economists and
	labor leaders, on the grounds of &ldquo;keeping up purchasing
	power&rdquo; to
	combat the depression. The drop in wage rates had been more
	extensive and far more prompt in the far milder 1921 depression;
	in fact, even <i>money</i>wage rates rose slightly until
	September, 1930.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-16">16</a></sup></font>
	More wage cuts took place in smaller than in larger firms, since the
	smaller firms were less &ldquo;enlightened,&rdquo; and
	furthermore, were not
	as fully in the public (and governmental) view. Furthermore, executive,
	and then other, salaries were generally reduced considerably
	more than wage rates. In fact, one reason that the eventual wage
	declines proved ineffective was the pseudo-humanitarian morality
	that governed the cuts when finally made: thus, reductions were
	automatically graduated in proportion to the income brackets of
	the workers, the higher brackets suffering greater declines. And
	reductions were often softened for workers with dependents. In
	short, instead of trying to adjust wage rates to marginal
	productivities, as was desperately needed, the firms allocated the
	&ldquo;loss in
	income on the most just and equitable [sic] basis . . . [actuated by
	the] desire to make the burden of reduced income fall as lightly as
	possible on those least able to suffer the loss.&rdquo; In short,
	each man
	was penalized according to his ability and subsidized according to
	the need for which he had voluntarily assumed the responsibility
	(his dependents). </p>
	
	
	
	<p>It was typical that executive
	salaries were the ones cut most
	promptly and severely, even though the great unemployment
	problem was <i>not</i> among the executives but among
	rank-and-file
	workers. As a result of this tragically wrong-headed policy, the
	wage cuts certainly stirred up little worker resentment, but also did
	little to help unemployment. In sum, management&rsquo;s attitude
	looked not for what &ldquo;reduction can most easily be made, but
	rather
	how can necessary payroll economies be accomplished with the
	least hardship for all concerned.&rdquo; This policy only <i>aggravated</i>
	the
	general hardship, as will always happen when business strays from
	its proper goal of maximizing profits.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-17">17 </a></sup></font></p>



	<p>While real average hourly
	earnings rose, actual hours worked in
	industry fell drastically during the depression. Weekly hours averaged
	over 48 in 1929, and fell to less than 32 by mid-1932. In no
	previous depression had hours worked fallen by more than 10 percent.
	This was a form of reduced employment caused by the highwage policy, a
	form, as we have seen, particularly recommended by
	the Hoover administration. As a result of the fall in hours worked
	and in money wage rates, average weekly earnings fell by over 40
	percent during the depression, and real weekly earnings fell by
	over 30 percent. But hardest hit were the unemployed, the percentage of
	whom rose to 25 percent by 1932&ndash;1933, and reached 47
	percent in the selected manufacturing industries. The fall in manhours
	worked, combined with the fall in average hourly earnings,
	caused a truly precipitate drop in total factory payrolls&mdash;the
	base of
	that very &ldquo;purchasing power&rdquo; that the
	&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; policy was supposed to sustain. Total
	payroll fell by over 29 percent in 1930, a year
	when money wage rates (average hourly earnings) rose to a higher
	level than 1929, and payroll had fallen by almost 71 percent by
	March, 1933. Real payroll fell by over 60 percent in the same period. </p>



	<p>The purchasing power theorists
	often declaim that the key to
	prosperity is national income going more to employees and less to
	profits: these conditions were filled to their hearts&rsquo;
	content during
	the depression. For aggregate profits were <i>negative</i>
	during 1932
	and 1933. </p>



	<p>Although unions were not
	particularly important in these years,
	amounting to only 6 percent of the labor force, Professor Levinson has
	shown that unions maintained higher wage rates for their
	employed workers than did comparable non-union workers.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-18">18</a></sup></font>
	This
	demonstrates the power of unions to maintain money wage rates
	during a depression, thereby aggravating the unemployment problem, and
	reinforcing the effects of Hoover&rsquo;s injunctions and
	&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; economic theory. Wage rates of
	selected union
	workers fell only 6&ndash;12 percent over the 1929&ndash;1932
	period, while
	the rates of non-union workers fell by 14&ndash;36 percent. </p>



	<p>Levinson points out that there
	is a close relationship between
	the strength of the union and the maintenance of wage rates in
	each specific industry. Thus, the union in the men&rsquo;s clothing
	industry had been greatly weakened in the 1920s by moves of industry
	from union to non-union areas, so that it had to accept wage
	reductions during the depression &ldquo;to protect the solvency of
	the
	organized employees&rdquo;; wage rates in this industry fell by 31
	percent during the 1929&ndash;32 period. </p>



	<p>Sharing-the-work by putting
	employees on reduced time was
	another favorite panacea of the Hoover administration. Yet, in
	1931 the President&rsquo;s Emergency Committee for Employment
	reported that, in a sample of manufacturing, plants with under
	1,000 employees suffered an unemployment problem in 75 percent
	of the cases, whereas 96 percent of the plants with over 5,000
	workers suffered from unemployment. Eighty-eight percent of the
	larger firms had engaged in work-sharing, while only 53 percent of
	the smaller firms did so. In a business and industrial conference of
	August 26, 1932, Hoover reported that work-sharing had been
	used for hundreds of thousands of workers. </p>



	<p>The Conference appointed a
	subcommittee headed by Walter
	Teagle, President of Standard Oil of New Jersey, to urge more
	work-spreading, in hopes of putting two million people back to
	work. Standard Oil set an example by hiring 3000 more workers in
	addition to its total of 23,000. The slogan adopted was: &ldquo;job
	security
	by job sharing.&rdquo; In September, William J. Barrett, of the
	President&rsquo;s
	Organization on Unemployment Relief, delivered a comprehensive
	report on work-spreading. Barrett admitted that &ldquo;management
	has
	undergone increased costs in providing employment for additional
	workers.&rdquo; He further revealed that the largest proportion of
	worksharing occurred in the most distressed industries: i.e., the
	capital
	goods industries. This illustrates the role that work-sharing played
	in aggravating and perpetuating unemployment. Thus, in a sample
	of industries, the largest proportion of part-time workers occurred
	in such fields as machinery (84.9 percent), rubber, iron, and steel
	(79.3 percent), metals, stone, clay, and glass, while the smallest
	proportion occurred in railroads (22.3 percent), foods (26.6 percent),
	retail and wholesale, and commercial establishments (20.4
	percent). The average part-time proportion for the entire sample
	was 56.1 percent.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#Note-12-19">19</a></sup></font></p>



	<center><h3>CONCLUSION: THE LESSONS
	OF MR. HOOVER&rsquo;S RECORD</h3></center>
	
	
	<p>Mr. Hoover met the challenge of
	the Great Depression by acting quickly and decisively, indeed almost
	continuously throughout
	his term of office, putting into effect &ldquo;the greatest program
	of
	offense and defense&rdquo; against depression ever attempted in
	America.
	Bravely he used every modern economic &ldquo;tool,&rdquo; every
	device of progressive and &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; economics,
	every facet of government
	planning, to combat the depression. For the first time, laissez-faire
	was boldly thrown overboard and every governmental weapon
	thrown into the breach. America had awakened, and was now
	ready to use the State to the hilt, unhampered by the supposed
	shibboleths of laissez-faire. President Hoover was a bold and audacious
	leader in this awakening. By every &ldquo;progressive&rdquo;
	tenet of our
	day, he should have ended his term a conquering hero; instead he
	left America in utter and complete ruin&mdash;a ruin unprecedented
	in
	length and intensity. </p>



	<p>What was the trouble? Economic
	theory demonstrates that
	only governmental inflation can generate a boom-and-bust cycle,
	and that the depression will be prolonged and aggravated by
	inflationist and other interventionary measures. In contrast to the
	myth
	of laissez-faire, we have shown in this book how government
	intervention generated the unsound boom of the 1920s, and how
	Hoover&rsquo;s new departure aggravated the Great Depression by
	massive measures of interference. The guilt for the Great Depression
	must, at long last, be lifted from the shoulders of the free-market
	economy, and placed where it properly belongs: at the doors of
	politicians, bureaucrats, and the mass of
	&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; economists.
	And in any other depression, past or future, the story will be the
	same.</p>
