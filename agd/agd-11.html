	<h3>The Hoover New Deal of 1932 </h3>


	</div>



	<p><font size="+2"><b>P</b></font>resident Hoover came to the
	legislative session of 1932 in an
	atmosphere of crisis, ready for drastic measures. In his
	annual message to Congress, on December 8, 1931, Hoover
	first reviewed his own accomplishments of
	the past two years: 
	<blockquote>Many undertakings have been
	organized and forwarded
	during the past year to meet the new and changing
	emergencies which have constantly confronted us . . . to
	cushion the violence of liquidation in industry and commerce, thus
	giving time for orderly readjustment of
	costs, inventories, and credits without panic and widespread
	bankruptcies. </blockquote>



	Measures such as Federal and
	state and local public works, worksharing, maintaining wage rates
	(&ldquo;a large majority have maintained
	wages at high levels&rdquo; as before), curtailment of immigration,
	and
	the National Credit Corporation, Hoover declared, have served
	these purposes and fostered recovery. Now, Hoover urged more
	drastic action, and he presented the following program: <br/>
	
	(1) Establish a
	Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which
	would use Treasury funds to lend to
	banks, industries, agricultural credit agencies, and local governments;<br/>



	(2) Broaden the eligibility requirement for discounting at the
	Fed;<br/>



	(3) Create a Home Loan Bank discount system to revive construction and
	employment measures which had been
	<!--Page>285-->
	warmly endorsed by a National
	Housing Conference recently
	convened by Hoover for that purpose; <br/>



	(4) Expand government aid to Federal Land Banks;<br/>



	(5) Set up a Public Works Administration to coordinate and
	expand Federal public works; <br/>



	(6) Legalize Hoover&rsquo;s order restricting immigration; <br/>



	(7) Do something to weaken &ldquo;destructive
	competition&rdquo; (i.e.,
	competition) in natural resource use;<br/>



	(8) Grant direct loans of $300 million to States for relief; <br/>



	(9) Reform the bankruptcy laws (i.e., weaken protection for the
	creditor). <br/>



	Hoover also displayed anxiety to
	&ldquo;protect railroads from unregulated competition,&rdquo;
	and to bolster the bankrupt railroad lines. In
	addition, he called for sharing-the-work programs to save several
	millions from unemployment. </p>



	<center><h3>THE TAX INCREASE</h3></center>
	
	<p>With a $2 billion deficit during
	annual year 1931, Hoover felt
	that he had to do something in the next year to combat it. Deficit
	spending is indeed an evil, but a balanced budget is not necessarily
	a good, particularly when the &ldquo;balance&rdquo; is obtained
	by increasing
	revenue and expenditures. If he wanted to balance the budget,
	Hoover had two choices open to him: to reduce expenditures, and
	thereby relieve the economy of some of the aggravated burden of
	government, or to increase that burden further by raising taxes. He
	chose the latter course. In his swan song as Secretary of Treasury,
	Andrew Mellon advocated, in December, 1931, drastic increases of
	taxes, including personal income taxes, estate taxes, sales taxes, and
	postal rates. Obedient to the lines charted by Mellon and Hoover,
	Congress passed, in the Revenue Act of 1932, one of the greatest
	increases in taxation ever enacted in the United States in peacetime.
	The range of tax increases was enormous. Many wartime
	excise taxes were revived, sales taxes were imposed on gasoline,
	tires, autos, electric energy, malt, toiletries, furs, jewelry, and
	other
	articles; admission and stock transfer taxes were increased; new
	taxes were levied on bank checks, bond transfers, telephone, telegraph,
	and radio messages; and the personal income tax was raised
	drastically as follows: the normal rate was increased from a range
	of 12 percent&ndash;5 percent, to 4 percent&ndash;8 percent;
	personal exemptions were sharply reduced, and an earned credit of 25
	percent
	eliminated; and surtaxes were raised enormously, from a maximum
	of 25 percent to 63 percent on the highest incomes. Furthermore,
	the corporate income tax was increased from 12 percent to l3:
	percent, and an exemption for small corporations eliminated; the
	estate tax was doubled, and the exemption floor halved; and the
	gift tax, which had been eliminated, was restored, and graduated
	up to 33a percent.<sup><a href="#Note-11-1">1 </a><sup>Hoover also tried his best
	to impose on the
	public a manufacturers&rsquo; sales tax, but this was successfully
	opposed
	by the manufacturers. We might mention here that for Hoover the
	great increase in the estate tax was moral <i>in itself</i>,
	in addition to its
	alleged usefulness as a fiscal measure. The estate tax, he declared,
	is &ldquo;one of the most economically and socially
	desirable&mdash;or even
	necessary of all taxes.&rdquo; He hinted darkly of the
	&ldquo;evils of inherited
	economic power,&rdquo; of &ldquo;cunning lawyers,&rdquo;
	and &ldquo;obnoxious&rdquo; playboys: there was no hint that he
	realized that a tax on inherited
	wealth is a tax on the property of the able or the descendants of the
	able, who must maintain that ability in order to preserve their
	fortunes; there was not the slightest understanding that a pure tax on
	capital such as the estate tax was the worst possible tax from the
	point of view of getting rid of the depression. </p>



	<p>The raising of postal rates
	burdened the public further and
	helped swell the revenues of a compulsory governmental monopoly. The
	letter rates were raised from 2&cent; to 3&cent; despite the
	fact that
	the Post Office&rsquo;s own accounting system already showed a
	large
	profit on first class mail. Postage on publishers&rsquo; second
	class mail
	was raised by about one-third, and parcel post rates on small
	parcels were increased by 25 percent (though rates on large parcels
	were lowered slightly).<sup><a href="#Note-11-2">2</a><sup> One of the most cogent
	critiques of
	Hoover&rsquo;s astoundingly wrong-headed program was delivered by
	the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce. Alarmed by the incessant
	call for higher taxes, the Chamber declared: 
	
	
	
	<blockquote>When governments seek to
	maintain the high levels of
	taxation they reached in good times in these days of seriously impaired
	income, the impending specter of higher
	taxes constitutes one of the chief deterrents of business
	recovery.</blockquote>



	The taxpayers, it insisted,
	should obtain a reduction of both taxes
	and government expenditures.<sup><a href="#Note-11-3">3</a><sup> And the <i>Atlanta
	Constitution</i> called
	the 1932 tax act &ldquo;the most vicious tax bill . . . ever
	saddled on the
	country in time of peace.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-11-4">4</a><sup></p>



	<center><h3>EXPENDITURES VERSUS ECONOMY</h3></center>
	
	<p>Despite the drastic increase in
	tax rates, total Federal revenue
	for 1932 declined because of the deepened depression&mdash;itself
	partly caused by the increase in tax rates. Total Federal receipts,
	excluding government enterprises, declined from $2.2 billion in
	1931 to $1.9 billion in 1932; including government enterprises,
	Federal receipts fell from $3.4 billion to $3 billion. Total government
	receipts fell from $12.4 billion to $11.5 billion including government
	enterprises, from $10.3 billion to $9.5 billion excluding
	them. As a result, the huge Federal deficit continued despite a drop
	in government expenditures in 1932: Federal expenditures falling
	from $4.4 billion to $3.4 billion (from $5.5 billion to $4.4 billion if
	we include government enterprises), and aggregate government
	expenditures falling from $13.3 billion to $11.4 billion (from $15.2
	billion to $13.2 billion if we include government enterprises). Of
	the $1.7 billion in total government deficit, the bulk of
	it&mdash;$1.4
	billion&mdash;was in the Federal government account. </p>
	
	<p>The decline of $1 billion in
	Federal expenditures over the year
	consisted of an $800 million decline in transfer payments
	(veterans&rsquo; loans), and a $200 million drop in grants to state
	and local
	governments. The drop in state and local government expenditures of
	$900 million in 1932 consisted largely of an $800 million
	decline in new construction. The state and local governments,
	which differ from the Federal government in not being able to
	print new money or new bank deposits by selling bonds to a controlled
	banking system, found by 1932 that their financial condition was too
	grave to permit continued public works on such a
	large scale. The state and local governments were therefore forced
	to cut back their expenditures to near the level of their dwindling
	receipts. </p>



	<p>What did all this mean for the
	fiscal burden of government on
	the economy? While the absolute amount of Federal depredations
	fell from $5.5 to $4.4 billion in 1932, and state and local burdens
	fell from $9.7 to $8.8 billion, GNP, and gross private product,
	declined far more drastically. GNP fell from $76.3 billion in 1931
	to $58.5 billion in 1932, while GPP fell from $70.9 billion to $53.3
	billion. Net private product fell from $62.7 to $45.7 billion.
	Hence, the percentage of Federal depredation on the gross private
	product rose from 7.8 percent in 1931 to 8.3 percent in 1932, and
	the percentage depredation of state and local governments rose
	from 13.7 percent to 16.5 percent. All in all, total fiscal burden of
	government on the gross private product rose from 21.5 percent to
	24.8 percent; total burden on the net private product rose from
	24.3 percent to 28.9 percent. </p>



	<p>One of the most ominous projects
	for Federal spending during
	1932 was a Congressional move for a huge $2 billion veterans
	bonus, to be financed by an issue of new currency. It was, indeed,
	the struggle over, and final defeat of, this program in the Senate in
	June that did most to defeat a general clamor for much larger
	government spending. The agitation for a veterans&rsquo; bonus gave
	rise to a
	National Economy Committee, organized by Colonel Archibald R.
	Roosevelt, to combat the proposal. The Committee later became the
	National Economy League, which grew active throughout the nation
	by mid-1932. Chairman of the League was Admiral Richard E. Byrd,
	who abandoned a polar expedition to take active part, and secretary was
	Captain Charles M. Mills. Begun by Colonel Roosevelt
	and Grenville Clark, the League acquired over 60,000 members in
	forty-five states. The League&rsquo;s objective was to cut the
	costs of
	government: &ldquo;We will not get back again to prosperity until
	high
	taxes are reduced.&rdquo; Taxation, it declared, now cripples
	industry,
	and hurts rich and poor alike. Unfortunately, the League was not
	willing to suggest specific areas of reduced spending&mdash;aside
	from
	veterans&rsquo; aid. Captain Mills simply assumed that public works
	could not be reduced, since they were needed to relieve unemployment,
	and national defense could not be reduced&mdash;despite the
	fact that no country was poised to attack the United Sates.<sup><a href="#Note-11-5">5</a><sup></p>



	<p>Other economizers were more
	stringent, and urged Hoover to
	balance the budget by reducing expenditures by $2 billion, rather
	than by raising taxes. These included the redoubtable Rep. James M.
	Beck of Pennsylvania, formerly Solicitor General of the United
	States.<sup><a href="#Note-11-6">6</a><sup> But Hoover rejected the pleas of
	numerous businessmen
	and bankers, many of them adherents of the Democratic Party. To
	one protesting businessman who urged him to reduce expenses by
	$2 billion, Hoover answered with the typical hysteria of the
	bureaucrat:



	
	<blockquote>Your thesis is that the
	government expenses can be
	reduced by $2 billion&mdash;the amount of the tax decrease.
	This is . . . wholly impossible. It would mean we must
	give up the postal service, the Merchant Marine, protection of life and
	property and public health. We would
	have to turn 40,000 prisoners loose in this country; we
	would have to stop the maintenance of rivers and harbors; we would have
	to stop all construction work going
	on in aid of unemployment; it would mean abolishment
	[sic] of the Army and Navy. In other words it means
	complete chaos. </blockquote></p>



	<p>Let us waive the important
	question whether many of these
	functions are really so vital, or whether they may only be performed by
	the compulsory monopoly of the Federal Government.
	Would a $2 billion budget cut have led to these effects? Taking the
	<i>fiscal</i> year 1932, the Federal expenditures
	(including government
	enterprises) of $4.8 billion equaled $59.50 per person in a
	&ldquo;real&rdquo;
	index based on the wholesale price level of 1926. During the
	1920s, the Federal Government spent a real amount of about $25
	per person, and from 1890&ndash;1916, spent approximately $10 per
	person. This means that the Federal budget could have been cut by
	$2.8 billion to maintain the services provided during the 1920s,
	and by $4.0 billion to maintain the services provided from
	1890&ndash;1916, <i>not</i> a period that lacked
	protection, post offices, etc.<sup><a href="#Note-11-7">7</a><sup></p>



	<p>While the economizers urged
	Hoover to cut expenditures and
	taxation, radicals urged a stepped-up program of government
	spending. William Trufant Foster, in a speech before the Taylor
	Society in the spring of 1932, called for
	&ldquo;collectively&rdquo; expanding
	currency and credit to restore the commodity price level of 1928.
	Virgil Jordan, economist for <i>Business Week</i>, urged
	expansion of public spending: &ldquo;Just as we saved our way into
	depression, we must
	squander our way out of it.&rdquo; This piece of advice was
	delivered
	before the annual banquet of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce. Also
	calling for increased spending and &ldquo;cyclical&rdquo;
	rather
	than annual budget balancing were such economists as Paul H.
	Douglas, R.M. Haig, Simeon E. Leland, Harry A. Millis, Henry C.
	Simons, Sumner H. Slichter, and Jacob Viner.<sup><a href="#Note-11-8">8 </a><sup></p>



	<center><h3>PUBLIC WORKS AGITATION</h3></center>
	
	<p>While expenditures were leveling
	out, agitators for ever-greater
	public works redoubled their propaganda during the spring of
	1932. Virgil Jordan, economist for<i> Business Week</i>,
	called for
	expanded public works, deficits, and pump-priming. W.T. Foster,
	Otto Tod Mallery, and David Cushman Coyle clamored for public
	works. Senators LaFollette and Wagner each sponsored huge public works
	bills, and they were supported by numerous economists
	and engineers. Senator Wagner sent a questionnaire on his $1 billion
	public works plan to numerous economists, and drew only a
	few dissents in the chorus of approval.<sup><a href="#Note-11-9">9</a><sup></p>



	<p>Felix Frankfurter thought that
	the program should go even further. Several economists, however,
	advised caution or expressed
	outright dissent, thus causing at least a welcome split in what had
	looked to laymen to be a solid phalanx of economists favoring a
	huge public works program. John
	Maurice Clark wrote that he was
	not sure, and was worried about the effect on public confidence
	and the weakening of bank credit that would ensue. Also worried
	about confidence and cautiously opposed were Professors Z.C.
	Dickinson, Henry B. Gardner, and Alvin H. Hansen. Firmer in
	opposition was Jacob Hollander of Johns Hopkins, who had signed
	the adverse report of the President&rsquo;s Committee a few months
	earlier.
	Hollander expressed concern over the credit structure and continued
	deficits. Edwin F. Gay of Harvard believed it imperative to
	economize and balance the budget. </p>



	<p>Willford I. King, of New York
	University, warned that wages
	must fall in proportion to the decline of commodity prices, in order
	to eliminate unemployment. He cogently pointed out that government
	employment at existing high wage rates would perpetuate the
	unemployment problem. Unfortunately, however, King suggested
	monetary inflation to restore the price level to 1926 levels. M.B.
	Hammond, of Ohio State University, delivered an excellent critique
	of the Wagner Bill. The proper course, he pointed out, was to
	economize, balance the budget, preserve the gold standard, and
	allow the needed price readjustments to take place: 



	<blockquote>conditions will be stabilized as
	soon as prices in certain
	lines have become adjusted to price reductions which
	have already taken place in other lines. Large appropriations for
	public works would hinder such an adjustment and consequently would be
	unfavorable to efforts
	which private industry will otherwise make to resume
	operations. </blockquote>



	One of the best comments on the
	proposal was delivered by
	William A. Berridge, economist for the Metropolitan Life Insurance
	Company. The bond issue for public works, he wrote, &ldquo;would
	encroach seriously, and perhaps dangerously upon the supply of
	capital funds that private enterprise will need in order to help the
	country climb out of depression again.&rdquo; The public works
	projects,
	he added, &ldquo;would undoubtedly freeze up the
	country&rsquo;s labor and
	capital in projects that would not contribute correspondingly to
	the productiveness and welfare of society in general.&rdquo;</p>
	
	
	
	<p>Further agitation for public works was carried on by the magazine <i>American
	City</i>, which called for a six-year program of lowinterest
	loans to public works , and by Colonel John P. Hogan,
	who proposed a Productive Research Work Corporation, to be
	worth $1.5 billion, for loans to local governments for public
	works.<sup><a href="#Note-11-10">10 </a><sup></p>



	<p>Hogan&rsquo;s scheme was
	endorsed by the Construction League of
	America, and by the Associated General Contractors of America,
	both naturally eager for government subsidies to the construction
	industry. In June, the construction industry sponsored a National
	Committee for Trade Recovery, to promote public works. Other
	zealots were J. Cheever Cowden, a New York investment banker,
	who proposed an annual $4&ndash;5 billion public-works program,
	Colonel Malcolm C. Rorty, who wanted $1 billion spent per year,
	Owen D. Young, Alfred E. Smith, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
	William Randolph Hearst suggested a $5.5 billion Property Bond
	issue for a Federal public-works program, and this was endorsed, in
	January, 1932, by thirty-one economists, including Thomas Nixon
	Carver, Paul H. Douglas, William Trufant Foster, Robert M.
	Maclver, and J. E. LeRossignol.<sup><a href="#Note-11-11">11</a><sup></p>



	<p>By the summer of 1932, three
	books had appeared that would
	form the bellwether of the Roosevelt New Deal. These called for
	heavy government spending, especially on public works, as well as
	for central planning of the economy; they were Stuart Chase&rsquo;s
	<i>The
	New Deal</i>, David Cushman Coyle&rsquo;s <i>The
	Irrepressible Conflict: Business vs. Finance</i>, and George
	Soule&rsquo;s <i>A Planned Society</i>. Their public
	works suggestions were endorsed by the<i> New Republic</i>
	and the
	American Federation of Labor. The U.S. Conference of Mayors
	urged a $5 billion public-works program, and the avowed Socialists
	Norman Thomas and Morris Hillquit topped everyone with a
	suggested $12 billion bond issue, one half to go for public works,
	and the other half for direct relief. </p>



	<p>In the meanwhile, however,
	President Hoover himself was
	beginning to have doubts about one of his favorite policies: public
	works. In a conference at the end of February, Hoover admitted
	that his public works program, which had nearly doubled Federal
	construction since the start of the depression, had failed. It was
	very expensive, costing over $1200 per family aided, it was unavailable
	to the needy in remote regions and to those who were unable
	to perform such labor, which was, after all, unskilled make-work.
	Hoover now was coming to favor more Federal grants-in-aid to
	states in <i>lieu</i> of more Federal public works. By
	May, Hoover had
	openly reversed his earlier position, and now opposed any further
	extension of non-self-liquidating public works. As a result, Federal
	public works only increased by $60 million in 1932, to reach the
	$333 million mark. Experience had led the President to curtail his
	public works experiment, and partially to renounce views that he
	had championed for over a decade. Public works was not to come
	really to the fore again until the Roosevelt administration.<sup><a href="#Note-11-12">12</a><sup>
	Despite this reversal, Hoover continued to insist on the merits of
	&ldquo;self-liquidating&rdquo; public works, and induced the
	Reconstruction
	Finance Corporation (RFC) to lend abundantly for public dams,
	toll bridges, and slum clearance. In fact, Hoover still recalls with
	pride that he personally induced state and local governments to
	expand their public-works programs by $1.5 billion during the
	depression. He still points out proudly that the aggregate public
	works of the four years of his administration was greater than the
	public works in the entire previous 30 years, and he still takes
	credit for launching, in this period, Jones Beach, the San Francisco
	Bay Bridge, the Los Angeles Aqueduct, and Boulder Dam. He also
	signed a treaty with Canada, in July, 1932, to build a joint
	governmental St. Lawrence Seaway, but the Senate of that era wisely
	refused to approve this boondoggle and subsidy to one form of
	water transportation. </p>



	<center><h3>THE RFC</h3></center>
	
	<p>On all other aspects of the
	Hoover New Deal, the President
	blossomed rather than faltered. The most important plank in his
	program&mdash;the RFC&mdash;was passed hurriedly in January by
	the Congress.<sup><a href="#Note-11-13">13</a><sup> The RFC was provided with
	government capital totaling
	$500 million, and was empowered to issue further debentures up
	to $1.5 billion. Hoover asked none other than Bernard Baruch to
	head the RFC, but Baruch declined. At that point, Hoover turned
	to name as Chairman one of his most socialistic advisers, the one
	who originally suggested the RFC to Hoover, Eugene Meyer, Jr.,
	an old friend of Baruch&rsquo;s.<sup><a href="#Note-11-14">14</a><sup> For the
	first five months of its life, the
	lending activities of the RFC lay shrouded in secrecy, and only
	determined action by the Democratic Congress finally forced the
	agency to make periodic public reports, beginning at the end of
	August. The bureaucratic excuse was that RFC loans should, like
	bank loans or previous National Credit Corporation (NCC) loans,
	remain confidential, lest public confidence in the aided bank or
	business firm be weakened. But the point is that, since the RFC
	was designed to lend money to unsound organizations about to
	fail, they <i>were</i> weak and the public <i>deserved</i>
	to lose confidence, and
	the sooner the better. Furthermore, since the taxpayers pay for
	government and are supposed to be its &ldquo;owners,&rdquo;
	there is no excuse
	for governmental representatives to keep secrets from their own
	principals. In a democracy, secrecy is particularly culpable: for how
	can the people possibly make intelligent decisions if the facts are
	withheld from them by the government? </p>



	<p>During the first five months of
	operation, from February to
	June, the RFC made $1 billion worth of loans, of which 80 percent
	was lent to banks and railroads, and about 60 percent to banks.
	The Republican claim that the RFC loans were not at all political
	rings pretty hollow in light of the facts. Thus, General Charles
	Dawes resigned as President of the RFC on June 7. Less than three
	weeks later, the Chicago bank which he headed, the Central
	Republic Bank and Trust Company, received an RFC loan of $90
	million even though the bank&rsquo;s total deposits were only $95
	million. That General Dawes resigned and then promptly asked for
	and received a huge loan for his own bank, certainly appears to be
	mulcting of the taxpayers by political collusion.<sup><a href="#Note-11-15">15</a><sup>
	In addition, the
	RFC granted a $14 million loan to the Union Trust Company of
	Cleveland; chairman of the board of this bank was none other than
	Joseph R. Nutt, treasurer of the Republican National Committee. </p>



	
	<p>The successor to Dawes as head
	of the RFC was the Hon. Atlee
	Pomerene, whose great contribution to economic wisdom was his
	pronouncement that he would like to compel all merchants to
	increase their purchases by 33 percent. There was the road to
	recovery! Under Pomerene&rsquo;s aegis, the FRC promptly authorized
	a $12.3 million loan to the Guardian Trust Company, of Cleveland, of
	which Pomerene was a director. Another loan of $7.4 million was made to
	the Baltimore Trust Company, the vice-chairman
	of which was the influential Republican Senator Phillips L.
	Goldsborough. A loan of $13 million was granted to the Union
	Guardian Trust Company of Detroit, a director of which was the
	Secretary of Commerce, Roy D. Chapin. </p>



	<p>Some $264 million were loaned to
	railroads during the five
	months of secrecy. The theory was that railroad securities must be
	protected, since many were held by savings banks and insurance
	companies, alleged agents of the small investor. Of the $187 million of
	loans that have been traced, $37 million were for the purpose of making
	improvements, and $150 million to repay debts.
	One of the first loans, for example, was a $5.75 million grant to the
	Missouri Pacific to repay its debt to J.P. Morgan and Company. A
	total of $11 million was loaned to the Van Sweringen railroads
	(including the Missouri Pacific) to repay bank loans. $8 million
	were loaned to the Baltimore and Ohio to repay a debt to Kuhn,
	Loeb and Company. All in all, $44 million were granted to the railroads
	by the RFC in order to repay bank loans. One of the main
	enthusiasts for this policy was Eugene Meyer, on the grounds of
	&ldquo;promoting recovery,&rdquo; and, frankly,
	&ldquo;putting more money into the
	banks.&rdquo; But this &ldquo;promotion of recovery&rdquo;
	really meant that the taxpayers were expropriated, and their money
	transferred by coercion
	to a few banks, notably J.P. Morgan and Company, and Kuhn,
	Loeb and Company. The extent of Meyer&rsquo;s humanitarianism in
	this affair may be gauged from the fact that his brother-in-law,
	George Blumenthal, was a member of J.P. Morgan and Company,
	and that Meyer had also served as a liaison officer between the
	Morgan firm and the French government. In the case of the Missouri
	Pacific, the RFC granted the loan despite an adverse warning
	by a minority of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and, as
	soon as the line had repaid its debt to Morgan, the Missouri Pacific
	was gently allowed to go into bankruptcy.<sup><a href="#Note-11-16">16</a><sup></p>



	<p>John T. Flynn, in a caustic article on
	the RFC, pointed out correctly that such loans could only prolong the
	depression: 
	
	
	<blockquote>Prices must come down to bring
	goods closer to the size
	of the available income . . . income itself must be freed
	for purchasing by the extinguishment of excessive debts.
	. . . Any attempt to hold up prices or to save the weaker
	debtors necessarily prolongs the depression. </blockquote>



	Flynn also firmly pointed out
	that the best way to relieve the railroads, shaky and hobbled by debt,
	was to go into the &ldquo;inevitable
	curative process&rdquo; of receivership: 



	<blockquote>The quicker the correction
	comes, the quicker the
	regeneration of the road will come. . . . Instead of permitting the
	correction of the fatal flaw [the heavy bond
	load], the RFC has actually added to the bond load [of
	the railroads].<sup><a href="#Note-11-17">17</a><sup></blockquote></p>



	<p>Despite the speedy enactment of
	the RFC, Hoover complained
	that the Democratic Congress had delayed its passage by six weeks,
	allowing securities to be depressed for this length of time below
	their &ldquo;true worth&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that may be.
	Hoover&rsquo;s chief complaint was that Congress did not permit the
	RFC to lend directly
	to industry, to agriculture, or to government for public works.
	Congress, in short, did not permit the RFC to loan widely and
	recklessly enough. </p>



	<p>At last, however, Hoover had his
	way, and Congress agreed to
	transform the RFC from a generally <i>defensive</i> agency
	aiding banks
	and railroads in debt, to a bold &ldquo;positive&rdquo;
	institution, making capital loans for new construction. This amendment,
	of July 21&mdash;the
	Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932&mdash;increased the
	RFC&rsquo;s authorized total capital from $2 billion to $3.8
	billion, and
	permitted loans to states or cities for relief and work relief, for
	selfliquidating construction projects, and for financing sales of
	agricultural surpluses abroad, orderly marketing in agriculture, and
	agricultural credit corporations.<sup><a href="#Note-11-18">18</a><sup> In a
	retrospective slap at General Dawes, loans were now forbidden to any
	bank of which a
	director or officer was a member of the RFC board. In a later
	amendment, the RFC was ordered to allocate $25 million of its
	funds to the Treasury to buy the stock of the 12 newly created Federal
	Home Loan Banks. </p>



	<p>Over the entire year 1932, the
	RFC extended credits totaling
	$2.3 billion, and advanced an actual $1.6 billion in cash. Of the
	year&rsquo;s advances, 52 percent were loaned to banks, 17 percent
	to
	railroads (of which over half went to repay debts to banks), and 9
	percent to agriculture. In the agricultural field, the RFC established
	regional agricultural credit corporations, and advanced
	them $1.4 million, which authorizing credits of $55 million by the
	end of the year. The RFC was particularly active in cotton loans.
	And although the American Engineering Council hopefully suggested a
	shelf of self-liquidating public works projects totaling $1
	billion (mainly water-supply and irrigation systems), the RFC only
	authorized $147 million, and advanced $16 million, for such projects
	during 1932. </p>



	<center><h3>GOVERNMENTAL RELIEF</h3></center>
	
	<p>If Hoover eagerly embraced the
	statism of the RFC, he gave
	ground but grudgingly on one issue where he had championed the
	voluntary approach: direct relief. Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt
	of New York led the way for state relief programs in the winter of
	1931&ndash;1932, and he induced New York to establish the first
	state
	relief authority: the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration,
	equipped with $25 million.<sup><a href="#Note-11-19">19</a><sup> Other states
	followed this lead, and
	Senators Costigan and LaFollette introduced a bill for a $500 million
	federal relief program.<sup><a href="#Note-11-20">20</a><sup> The bill was defeated,
	but, with
	depression deepening and a Presidential election approaching, the
	administration all but surrendered, passing the Emergency Relief
	and Construction Act of July, 1932&mdash;the nation&rsquo;s
	first Federal
	relief legislation.<sup><a href="#Note-11-21">21</a><sup> The bill did not go nearly
	as far as the agitators
	desired, extending loans for state relief rather than direct grants to
	states, but this was a trivial difference. The loans to the states were
	to be made by the RFC at 3 percent on the basis of
	&ldquo;need&rdquo; as
	requested by the respective governors. The RFC was authorized to
	lend up to $300 million for this purpose. Grants were quickly made
	to Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio,
	Utah, Louisiana, and Oregon. The RFC hired a staff of social
	workers, headed by Fred Croxton, to administer the program. </p>



	<p>The states, too, expanded their
	relief programs. While total
	state expenditures for emergency relief was $547 thousand in
	1930-1931, they totaled $57 million in 1931&ndash;1932, and $90
	million in fiscal year 1933. New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
	led in relief expenditures, Pennsylvania financing much of its aid
	by a newly-imposed sales tax. All in all, total public relief in 120 of
	the nation&rsquo;s leading urban areas amounted to $33 million in
	1929,
	$173 million in 1931, and $308 million in 1932.<sup><a href="#Note-11-22">22</a><sup></p>



	<center><h3>THE INFLATION PROGRAM</h3></center>
	
	<p>One thing Hoover was not
	reticent about: launching a huge
	inflationist program. First, the administration cleared the path for
	the program by passing the Glass&ndash;Steagall Act in February,
	which
	(a) greatly broadened the assets eligible for rediscounts with the
	Fed, and (b) permitted the Federal Reserve to use government
	bonds as collateral for its notes, in addition to commercial paper.<sup><a href="#Note-11-23">23</a><sup>
	The way was now cleared for a huge program of inflating reserves
	and engineering cheap money once again. Furthermore, Eugene
	Meyer, Jr. was now Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and
	Ogden Mills had replaced the more conservative Andrew Mellon
	as Secretary of the Treasury. At the end of February, 1932, total
	bank reserves had fallen to $1.85 billion. At that point, the FRS
	launched a gigantic program of purchasing U.S. government securities.
	By the end of 1932, total reserves had been raised to $2.51
	billion. This enormous increase of $660 million in reserves in less
	than a year is unprecedented in the previous history of the System.
	If the banks had kept loaned-up, the money supply of the nation
	would have increased by approximately $8 billion. Instead, the
	money supply fell by $3.5 billion during 1932, from $68.25 to
	$64.72 billion at the end of the year, and with the bank deposit
	component falling by $3.2 billion. </p>



	
	<p>The monetary history of the year
	is best broken up into two parts:
	end of February&ndash;end of July, and end of July&ndash;end of
	December. In
	the first period, total reserves rose by $213 million. The entire
	securities-buying program of the Federal Reserve took place during this
	first period, security holdings rising from $740 million at
	the end of February to $1,841 million at the end of July, an enormous
	$1,101 million rise in five months. Total controlled reserves
	rose by $1,000 million. This was offset by a $290 million reduction
	in bank indebtedness to the Fed, a sharp $380 million fall in the
	total gold stock, and a $122 million rise in money in circulation, in
	short, a $788 million reduction in uncontrolled reserves. For
	open-market purchases to be pursued precisely when the gold
	stock was falling was pure folly, and endangered public confidence
	in the government&rsquo;s ability to maintain the dollar on the
	gold standard. One reason for the inflationary policy was the huge
	Federal
	deficit of $3 billion during fiscal 1932. Since the Treasury was
	unwilling to borrow on long-term bonds from the public, it borrowed on
	short-term from the member banks, and the Federal Reserve was
	obliged to supply the banks with sufficient reserves. </p>



	<p>Despite this great inflationary
	push, it was during this half year
	that the nation&rsquo;s bank deposits fell by $3.1 billion; from
	then on,
	they remained almost constant until the end of the year. Why this
	fall in money supply just when one would have expected it to rise?
	The answer is the emergence of the phenomenon of &ldquo;excess
	reserves.&rdquo; Until the second quarter of 1932, the
	nation&rsquo;s banks had
	always remained loaned up, with only negligible excess reserves.
	Now the banks accumulated excess reserves, and Currie estimates
	that the proportion of excess to total bank reserves rose from 2.4
	percent in the first quarter of 1932, to 10.7 percent in the second
	quarter.<sup><a href="#Note-11-24">24</a><sup></p>



	<p>Why the emergence of excess
	reserves? In the first place, Fed
	purchase of government securities was a purely artificial attempt to
	dope the inflation horse. The drop in gold demanded a reduction
	in the money supply to maintain public confidence in the dollar and
	in the banking system; the increase of money in circulation out of
	season was an ominous sign that the public was losing confidence
	in the banks, and a severe bank contraction was the only way to
	regain that confidence. In the face of this requirement for deflation,
	the Fed embarked on its gigantic securities-buying program.
	Naturally, the banks, deeply worried by the bank failures that had
	been and were still taking place, were reluctant to expand their
	deposits further, and failed to do so. A common explanation is that
	the demand for loans by business fell off during the depression,
	because business could not see many profitable opportunities
	ahead. But this argument overlooks the fact that banks never have
	to be passive, that if they really wanted to, they could buy existing
	securities, and increase deposits that way. They do not have to
	depend upon business firms to request commercial loans, or to
	float new bond issues. The reason for excess reserves must be
	found, therefore, in the banks. </p>



	<p>In a time of depression and
	financial crisis, banks will be reluctant to lend or invest, (a) to
	avoid endangering the confidence of
	their customers; and (b) to avoid the risk of lending to or investing
	in ventures that might default. The artificial cheap money policy
	in 1932 greatly lowered interest rates all-around, and therefore
	further discouraged the banks from making loans or investments.
	just when risk was increasing, the<i> incentive to bear risk</i>&mdash;the
	prospective interest-return&mdash;was being lowered by governmental
	manipulation. And, as we noted above, we must not overlook the
	frightening effect of the wave of bank failures on bank policies.
	During the 1920s, a typical year might find 700 banks failing, with
	deposits totaling $170 million. In 1930, 1350 banks failed, with
	deposits of $837 million; in 1931, 2,293 banks collapsed, with
	deposits of $1,690 million; and in 1932, 1,453 banks failed, having
	$706 million in deposits. This enormous increase in bank failures
	was enough to give any bank pause&mdash;particularly when the
	bankers
	knew in their hearts that no bank (outside of the nonexisting ideal
	100 percent bank) can ever withstand a determined run. Consequently,
	the banks permitted their commercial loans to run down
	without increasing their investments. </p>
	
	<p>Thus, the Hoover administration
	pursued a giant inflationary
	policy from March through July 1932, raising controlled reserves
	by $1 billion through Fed purchase of government securities. If all
	other factors had remained constant, and banks fully loaned up,
	the money supply would have risen abruptly and wildly by over
	$10 billion during that period. Instead, and fortunately, the
	inflationary policy was reversed and turned into a rout. What defeated
	it? Foreigners who lost confidence in the dollar, partly as a result
	of the program, and drew out gold; American citizens who lost
	confidence in the banks and changed their deposits into Federal
	Reserve notes; and finally, bankers who refused to endanger themselves
	any further, and either used the increased resources to repay
	debt to the Federal Reserve or allowed them to pile up in the
	vaults. And so, fortunately, inflation by the government was turned
	into deflation by the policies of the public and the banks, and the
	money supply dropped by $3.5 billion. As we shall see further
	below, the American economy reached the depths of depression
	during 1932 and 1933, and yet it had begun to turn upward by
	mid-1932. It is not far-fetched to believe that the considerable <i>deflation</i>
	of July 1931&ndash;July 1932, totaling $7.5 billion of currency and
	deposits, or 14 percent, was partly responsible for the mid-summer
	upturn.<sup><a href="#Note-11-25">25</a><sup></p>



	<p>The major increase in bank
	reserves came in the latter half of
	1932, when reserves rose from $2.05 to $2.51 billion, or by $457
	million. Yet this rise was not caused by FRB security-buying, for
	the Hoover administration had by then ceased purchasing, apparently
	realizing that little or nothing was being accomplished. With
	the <i>end</i> of Hoover&rsquo;s inflation, the gold
	stock reversed itself, and
	money in circulation even declined, violating its normal seasonal
	pattern. In this second period, controlled reserves increased by
	$165 million; and uncontrolled reserves rose by $293 million:
	chiefly gold stock, which increased by $539 million. The money
	supply, however, remained practically constant, currency and bank
	deposits totaling $45.36 billion at the end of the year. In short, in
	the second half of 1932, gold swarmed into the United States, and
	money in circulation also fell. </p>



	<p>The public was therefore no
	longer a help in fighting inflation.
	In the face of the huge and rapid increase in gold stock, the
	administration did nothing, whereas it should have sterilized the
	increase
	by tightening money and selling some of its swollen hoard of
	securities. In the face of the great increase in reserves, therefore,
	the
	bankers once again came to the nation&rsquo;s monetary rescue by
	piling
	up ever greater excess reserves, and also by reducing some indebtedness
	at the Fed. Currie estimates that by the fourth quarter of
	1932, excess reserves had doubled, to equal 20.3 percent of total
	bank reserves. </p>



	<p>Professor Seymour Harris,
	writing at the depth of the depression at a time when he was a cautious
	moderate, conceded that the
	failure of the inflationist policy of the Federal Reserve might have
	been due to the fact &ldquo;that liquidation has not proceeded far
	enough.&rdquo; Furthermore, he added, the sound-money critics of
	the
	Administration might be right, and it may be that the heavy openmarket
	purchases of securities from 1930 to 1932 &ldquo;have retarded
	the process of liquidation and reduction of costs, and therefore
	have accentuated the depression.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-11-26">26 </a><sup>Precisely.	</p>



	<p>If Hoover&rsquo;s
	inflationist plans were thwarted variously by foreigners, the public,
	and the banks, the President did not permit
	himself to remain idle in the face of these obstacles. About foreigners
	he could do little, except to induce Congress to pass the
	Glass&ndash;Steagall Act to permit more leeway for domestic
	expansion.
	Hoover was only a moderate inflationist relative to many others,
	and he did not wish to go off the gold standard. About the public,
	however, Hoover could do a great deal. Seeing money-in-circulation
	increase by $800 million in 1931, Hoover engineered a coordinated
	hue-and-cry against &ldquo;traitorous hoarding.&rdquo;
	&ldquo;Hoarding,&rdquo; of
	course, meant that individuals were choosing to redeem their own
	property, to ask banks to transform their deposits into the cash
	which the banks had promised to have on hand for redemption. </p>



	<p>It is characteristic of
	depressions that, because of the inherently
	fraudulent nature of the commercial banking system, any real
	attempt by the public to redeem its own property from the banks
	must cause panic among banks and government alike. And so, on
	February 3, Hoover organized an anti-hoarding drive, headed by a
	Citizens&rsquo; Reconstruction Organization (CRO) under Colonel
	Frank Knox of Chicago. The hoarder is unpatriotic, ran the hue
	and cry; he restricts and destroys credit (i.e., he is exposing the
	unsound nature of the credit which was granted against his interests
	and in destruction of his property). A group of top-level AntiHoarding
	patriots met on February 6 to organize the drive: present were General
	Dawes, Eugene Meyer, Secretaries Lamont and
	Mills, A.F. Whitney, Alvanley Johnston, and industrialist Magnus
	Alexander. The CRO urged hoarders to invest in short-term Treasury
	securities, i.e., in unproductive rather than productive investments.
	On March 6, Hoover delivered a public address on the evils
	of hoarding: &ldquo;the battle front today is against the hoarding
	of currency.&rdquo; Hoarding has lowered prices and incomes, and
	restricted
	credit; it strangles our daily life. &ldquo;No one will deny that
	if the vast
	sums of money hoarded in the country today could be brought into
	active circulation there would be a great lift to the whole of our
	economic progress.&rdquo; Hoover then commended Colonel Knox for
	his &ldquo;great battle against . . . the American people, and
	called on
	everyone to serve in protection of the American home.&rdquo;
	Perhaps
	Hoover is correct when he now gives credit to the Knox drive for
	the fact that &ldquo;hoarding&rdquo; never increased much
	during 1932: it
	reached a peak of $5.44 billion in July, and never rose above that
	until the bank crises in February, 1933. But if Hoover is correct,
	praise is not his appropriate reward. For it means that bank
	liquidation was postponed for another year and the final banking crisis
	intensified, and it also means that the public was not at last
	permitted to find out for itself the great truth of the nature of its
	banking system. </p>



	<p>The banks also received their
	share of Hoover&rsquo;s ire for their
	unwillingness to expand in those troubled times. <i>The New York
	Times</i> reported on May 20 that Hoover was &ldquo;disturbed
	at the
	apparent lack of cooperation of the commercial banks of the country in
	the credit expansion drive.&rdquo; In short, the &ldquo;banks
	have not
	passed the benefits of these relief measures on to their
	customers.&rdquo;
	The anger of the inflationist authorities at the caution of the banks
	was typified by the arrogant statement of RFC chairman, Atlee
	Pomerene: &ldquo;Now . . . and I measure my words, the bank that is
	75
	percent liquid or more and refuses to make loans when proper
	security is offered, under present circumstances, is a parasite on
	the community.&rdquo; And Hoover had certainly done his very best
	to
	spark the bank credit expansion. It was he who induced Congress
	to pass the Glass&ndash;Steagall Act, and he and Meyer who
	conducted
	the open-market purchases of $1 billion. After the
	Glass&ndash;Steagall
	and RFC Acts were passed, Hoover proclaimed that they would
	&ldquo;so strengthen our whole credit structure and open the
	channels of
	credit as now to permit our banks more adequately to serve the
	needs&rdquo; of the public. On May 19, Hoover tried to prod the
	banks
	by asking Secretary Mills to organize bankers and businessmen to
	use the surplus credit made available by the Federal Reserve purchases.
	A Committee was established in New York City for this
	purpose; on it were such men as Owen D. Young, chairman, Walter S.
	Gifford of AT&amp;T, Charles E. Mitchell of the National City
	Bank, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., of General Motors, and Walter C. Teagle of
	Standard Oil. The next day, May 20, Hoover issued a press
	release supporting this committee, and hoping for similar action
	throughout the nation. The Young Committee tried to organize a
	cartel to support bond prices, but the committee accomplished little,
	and the idea died. </p>



	<center><h3>THE INFLATION AGITATION</h3></center>
	
	<p>It is thus with considerable
	justification that Herbert Hoover
	was to declare in later years: &ldquo;after coming to the
	Presidency,
	almost the whole of Roosevelt&rsquo;s credit supports were built
	upon
	our measures.&rdquo; Despite his intervention and inflationism,
	however,
	Hoover considered himself sound next to some of the wildly inflationist
	schemes that were filling the air during 1932. The silver
	bloc, for one, stepped up its campaign for an international conference
	to raise and stabilize the price of silver. They now added proposals
	for bimetallic systems. Backing these efforts were Senators
	King, Smoot, and Borah from the Mountain states, the International
	Chamber of Commerce, and the American Federation of
	Labor. Senator Burton K. Wheeler (D., Mont.) introduced a
	bimetallism bill with the old battle-cry of 16:1, fittingly enough in
	collaboration with William Jennings Bryan, Jr. The Bimetallic
	Association was formed to back such a bill in February, and it was
	also defended by the left-wing National Farmers&rsquo; Union. One
	of
	the articulate leaders of the silver-subsidy bloc was Ren&eacute;
	Leon,
	who became adviser to the House Ways and Means Committee,
	and induced the Committee to suggest the international conference.
	Neither of these proposals passed a house of Congress. </p>



	<p>Meanwhile, more and more
	economists and politicians were
	advocating credit expansion, some as a means of
	&ldquo;reflating&rdquo; the
	price level back to pre-depression levels. Curiously enough, the
	price-level stabilizationists, headed by Irving Fisher, whom we
	have discussed above, no longer wanted mere stabilization: they,
	too, wanted to reflate the price level back to pre-depression
	standards, and only <i>then</i> to stabilize. There is no
	better proof that these
	economists were always inflationists first, and stabilizationists
	second. Norman Lombard and the Stable Money Association continued to
	call for stabilization; before it closed down, it helped to start
	and was superseded by the powerful Committee for the Nation,
	dedicated frankly to reflation, and highly influential in finally
	getting the country off the gold standard in 1933&ndash;34. The
	Committee for the Nation was founded by veteran stabilizationist Frank
	A.
	Vanderlip, former President of the National City Bank of New
	York, and by James H. Rand, Jr., President of Remington Rand
	Company. Others cooperating in founding the Committee in late
	1932 were Vincent Bendix, General Robert E. Wood of SearsRoebuck,
	Magnus W. Alexander of the National Industrial Conference Board, Fred
	H. Sexauer, a farm leader, E.L. Cord, and
	Frederic H. Frazier, Chairman of the General Baking Company.
	When the Committee for the Nation organized formally in January, 1933,
	its executive secretary was Edward A. Rumely, and
	another of its leaders was Lessing J. Rosenwald. </p>



	<p>Inflationist efforts in Congress
	during these years included:
	Representative Wright Patman&rsquo;s bill for a soldiers&rsquo;
	bonus with fiat
	money (see above); Senator Walsh&rsquo;s plan for fiat money;
	Representative Burtness&rsquo; (N. Dak.) plan to
	&ldquo;stabilize the buying power of
	money,&rdquo; and another bill to &ldquo;raise the commodity
	price level to the
	debt-incurring stage and to stabilize it thereafter.&rdquo;
	Burtness&rsquo;s bill
	was introduced in December, 1931, and, in the same month, Rep.
	Christian Ramseyer of Iowa introduced a bill to &ldquo;restore and
	maintain the level of wholesale prices,&rdquo; directing the
	Federal Reserve to
	inflate prices back to 1926 levels. A similar bill was presented by
	Rep. Kent Keller of Illinois. </p>



	<p>The most important inflationist
	bill came before the House Banking and Currency Committee in March,
	1932. The Goldsborough
	Bill charged the Federal Reserve System with the duty of reflating
	to pre-depression price-levels and then stabilizing; also, the Fed
	was to be given power to raise or lower the gold weight of the dollar
	when it deemed necessary, a harking back to Irving Fisher&rsquo;s
	old
	scheme of the &ldquo;compensated dollar.&rdquo; Supporting the
	Goldsborough Bill in the hearings were: Edward A. O&rsquo;Neal,
	President of the
	Farm Bureau Federation, which had established a Committee on
	Stabilization of the Unit of Value, for reflating the price level;
	Louis J. Taber of the National Grange; and John A. Simpson of the
	National Farmers&rsquo; Union, all of whom doubted that the bill
	went
	far enough; Henry A. Wallace; ex-Senator Robert L. Owen; Professor
	Willford I. King, who also wanted the bill to go further;
	Alvin T. Simonds, President of the Simonds Saw and Steel Company;
	Colonel Malcolm C. Rorty; W.C. Hushing of the American
	Federation of Labor; Professor Irving Fisher; and George H. Shibley.
	The House frightened the administration and conservative
	opinion by passing the Goldsborough Bill on May 2 by the overwhelming
	margin of 289 to 60. The stabilizationists had reached
	their high water mark. The New York Merchants&rsquo; Association
	strongly attacked the bill, and the <i>Commercial and Financial
	Chronicle</i>&mdash;throughout the 1920s a bellwether of
	sound money&mdash;
	attacked both the Goldsborough Bill and the opposing Federal
	Reserve authorities in its issue of May 7: 



	<blockquote>It seems useless to argue
	against follies such as those
	embodied in the Goldsborough Bill, when our legislators have lost all
	sense and reason, and the only hope is
	that the movement can be held under definite control
	before it is carried too far. We grieve to have to say that
	the Federal Reserve authorities are chargeable with a
	portion at least of the blame in inculcating the unsound
	doctrines which are finding such wide acceptance today
	through the Reserve policy of the largescale purchases
	of United States Government Securities.</blockquote> </p>



	<p>The Federal Reserve authorities
	strongly opposed the Goldsborough Bill (now Fletcher Bill) in the
	Senate. The best of these
	antagonists was Dr. Adolph C. Miller, who cogently charged that
	a reflation attempt could only aggravate the depression. Miller
	asserted that if the Federal Reserve had been operating under this
	bill during the late 1920s, the depression would now be even worse
	than it is. The Bill was stopped in committee by the efforts of
	Secretary Mills and Senator Glass. </p>



	<p>Also agitating for inflation
	were Professors Commons, Edie,
	Friday, Kemmerer, Persons, and Rogers, Colonel Leonard P. Ayres,
	Father Charles Coughlin, broker Robert M. Harriss, and Dr. Ivan
	Wright. Donald Richberg urged emergency loans to the unemployed.
	Undoubtedly the wildest of all the monetary schemes were
	those that envisioned Federal support for some sort of separate
	<i>barter</i> system among the unemployed. Here, at last,
	the absurd
	schemes of statists and inflationists reached an apogee: a virtually
	conscious withdrawal from the civilized monetary economy, and a
	step toward return to the primitive realm of barter. </p>



	<p>It is particularly astounding
	that many famous economists, undoubtedly nonplussed by the depression,
	lent their names to barter
	schemes. Professor Frank D. Graham, of Princeton University, concocted
	an elaborate plan for an Emergency Employment Corporation (EEC), to be
	established by the federal government, for putting
	the unemployed to work in producing consumer goods, in return for
	scrip, based apparently on labor-hours, issued by the EEC.<sup><a href="#Note-11-27">27</a><sup>
	Similar
	plans were suggested by Professor Willford I. King of New York
	University, and Howard O. Eaton of the University of Oklahoma. And
	finally, a whole battery of economists, headed by Professor J. Douglas
	Brown, director of the industrial relations section
	of Princeton University, and former member of the President's
	Emergency Committee for Employment, signed a petition for federal and
	state aid for establishing barter systems, where the unemployed would
	produce for their <i>own</i> consumption, outside of the
	civilized market economy.<sup><a href="#Note-11-28">28</a><sup></p>



	<p>It is a sobering lesson on how
	the country was being governed,
	that of the signers, Mallery, Willits, and Wolman were members of
	the Hoover Emergency Committee for Employment; Willits was
	an adviser to the Pennsylvania state unemployment committee;
	Leiserson was chairman of the Ohio State Commission on Unemployment
	Insurance; Douglas had been technical adviser to the
	New York State Unemployment Relief Committee; and Graham
	had been an adviser of the Federal Farm Board.<sup><a href="#Note-11-29">29</a><sup></p>



	<p>In the month of January, 1932, two important groups of economists gave
	their blessings to an expanded inflation program&mdash;
	though not going as far as barter or scrip. Dr. Warren M. Persons,
	formerly of Harvard University, organized a statement
	asserting that there was fairly &ldquo;general agreement&rdquo;
	in the economics profession on two steps&mdash;credit expansion by
	the Federal
	Reserve in collaboration with commercial banks, and passage of
	the pending RFC. Among the signers of the Persons statement:
	Thomas Nixon Carver, John Maurice Clark, John R. Commons,
	Paul H. Douglas, Irving Fisher, David Friday, Jacob Hollander,
	Virgil Jordan, Edwin W. Kemmerer, Father John A. Ryan, Edwin
	R.A. Seligman, Frank W. Taussig, and Henry A. Wallace.<sup><a href="#Note-11-30">30</a><sup></p>



	<p>One of the most important
	expressions of monetary and fiscal
	thought by economists in the depression was a conference of some
	of the nation&rsquo;s leading economists in January, 1932, at the
	University of Chicago, under the aegis of the Institute on Gold and
	Monetary Stabilization.<sup><a href="#Note-11-31">31</a><sup> The Chicago meeting
	received wide notice,
	as well it might. Twenty-four economists there recommended the
	following to President Hoover: (1) what later became the
	Glass&ndash;Steagall Act; (2) a systematic campaign of FRB
	open-market
	purchases of securities; (3) RFC aid to banks with ineligible assets;
	(4) maintaining a public-works program; (5) Federal unemployment
	relief; and (6) lowering tariffs. With the exception of the last plank,
	President Hoover, as we have seen, adopted every one of these
	inflationary and interventionist proposals. Part of the responsibility
	for the Hoover program and its aggravation of the depression
	must therefore rest on these eminent advisers who steered him so
	incorrectly.<sup><a href="#Note-11-32">32</a><sup></p>
	
	
	
	<p>Unfortunately, these
	distinguished economists did not heed the
	words of two of the lecturers at the conference, who most emphatically
	did not sign the statement. One was Professor H. Parker
	Willis, who again proved prophetic in attacking the Federal
	Reserve&rsquo;s past and projected future inflationary policy
	during the
	depression. Willis pointed out that the cheap money policy in late
	1929 and in 1931 caused a dangerous outflow of gold, and led
	therefore to loss of confidence in the dollar and to bank failures,
	which accentuated the loss of confidence. He warned that any
	securities-buying program might indeed raise prices but: 



	<blockquote>any such step at the present
	time would simply mean an
	aggravation of existing difficulties, due to the fact that
	we are already overburdened with construction work
	and fixed capital that are not likely soon to be employed.</blockquote> </p>



	<p>In short, wasteful
	malinvestments would only be aggravated.
	The gold standard would also be gravely endangered. In short,
	inflation and cheap money retard &ldquo;progress toward the
	reestablishment of a solid . . . system of prices and
	values.&rdquo; Willis called
	courageously for a hands-off policy by the Federal Reserve.<sup><a href="#Note-11-33">33</a><sup></p>



	<p>The other notable contribution
	to the conference was delivered
	by Professor Gottfried von Haberler, at that time a follower of
	Ludwig von Mises. Haberler here presented for perhaps the first
	time in America the Misesian theory of the business cycle.<sup><a href="#Note-11-34">34</a><sup>
	He
	pointed out that the traditional monetary theory of the trade cycle
	emphasized stability of the price level, with an attack on falling
	prices
	as the remedy for depression. Such were the doctrines of Fisher,
	Cassel, and Hawtrey. The price level, however, is a misleading guide,
	since credit expansion also has a fundamental influence on the
	structure of production. Furthermore, the price-level theories err
	by not distinguishing between a
	fall of price due to a contraction
	of money, and that due to a lowering of costs from increases in
	productivity. In 1924&ndash;1929, Haberler continued, there was a
	great
	growth in production, but wholesale commodity prices remained
	stable, because the volume of money increased.<sup><a href="#Note-11-35">35</a><sup>
	This inflation
	brought on the succeeding depression. First it lengthened the
	period of production, because interest was lowered artificially as
	credit expanded. The subsequent depression, Haberler continued,
	is the necessary adjustment and abandonment of these longer
	processes, and the restoration of the old
	consumption&ndash;investment
	proportions. Consequently, shifts of capital and labor must occur
	before recovery can be won. The &ldquo;quacks . . . preaching
	inflationary measures,&rdquo; charged Haberler, disregard the real
	dislocation of
	productive resources. Further inflation would make things worse
	by creating a greater artificial disproportion of consumers&rsquo;
	and
	producers&rsquo; goods. The worst step would be &ldquo;a
	one-sided strengthening of the purchasing power of the consumer,
	because it was precisely this disproportional increase of demand for
	consumers&rsquo;
	goods which precipitated the crisis.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#Note-11-36">36</a><sup></p>



	
	<center><h3>MR. HOOVER&rsquo;S WAR ON THE STOCK MARKET</h3></center>
	
	<p>During 1932, President Hoover greatly stepped up his oneman war on the
	stock market, particularly on shortsellers, whom
	he na&iuml;vely and absurdly persisted in blaming for the fall in
	stock
	prices. Hoover forgot that bulls and bears always exist, and that for
	every bear bet there must be an offsetting bull, and also forgot that
	speculation smooths fluctuations and facilitates movement toward
	equilibrium. On February 16, Hoover called in the leaders of the
	New York Stock Exchange and threatened governmental coercion
	unless it took firm action against the &ldquo;bears,&rdquo; the
	shortsellers. The
	Exchange tried to comply, but not aggressively enough for
	Hoover, who declared himself unsatisfied. </p>



	<p>Having warned the Exchange of a
	Congressional investigation,
	Hoover induced the Senate to investigate the Stock Exchange,
	even though he admitted that the Federal Government had no
	constitutional jurisdiction over a purely New York institution. The
	President used continual pressure to launch the investigation of
	what he termed &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; &ldquo;systematic
	bear raids,&rdquo; &ldquo;vicious pools . . .
	pounding down&rdquo; security prices, &ldquo;deliberately
	making a profit
	from the losses of other people.&rdquo; Beside such demagogic
	rhetoric,
	constitutional limitations seemed pale indeed. Secretary of Commerce
	Lamont protested against the investigation, as did many
	New York bankers, but Hoover was not to be dissuaded. In
	answering the New York bankers, Hoover used some unknown
	crystal ball to assert that present prices of securities did not
	represent &ldquo;true values.&rdquo; The stock market viciously
	persisted in judging
	stocks according to their earnings, a useful criterion that Hoover
	seemed to find vaguely traitorous: 



	<blockquote>the pounding of prices to a
	basis of earnings by obvious
	manipulation of the market and propaganda that values
	should be based on earnings at the bottom of a depression
	is an injury to the country and to the investing public.</blockquote>



	Instead, the public should be
	&ldquo;willing to invest on the basis of the
	future of the United States.&rdquo; </p>
	
	<p>Hoover&rsquo;s persistent
	calumniation of the &ldquo;rottenness&rdquo; of the
	stock market finally bore fruit in the Senate investigation which
	led to the resignation of Albert Wiggin of the Chase National
	Bank, and blackmailed the stock-exchange generally&mdash;with
	clearcut, negative effects on business confidence. The stock
	exchange was bullied into restricting short-selling, and Hoover
	went on to propose further controls of the stock market, in
	anticipation of the later Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC);
	including compulsory stock prospectuses, increased liability of
	promoters, and Congressional rules for security exchanges. It is no
	wonder that Hoover later had a decidedly benign attitude toward
	the New Deal&rsquo;s SEC. </p>



	<center><h3>THE HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM</h3></center>
	
	<p>President Hoover, we remember,
	had wanted to establish a
	grandiose mortgage discount bank system to include all financial
	institutions, but the rejection of the scheme by insurance companies
	forced him to limit compulsory coverage to the building-andloan
	associations. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act was passed in
	July, 1932, establishing 12 district banks ruled by a Federal Home
	Loan Bank Board in a manner similar to the Federal Reserve System. $125
	million capital was subscribed by the Treasury, and this
	was subsequently shifted to the RFC. Hoover complained that
	Congress hamstrung his program by limiting discounted mortgages
	to 50 percent of value, whereas Hoover had wanted mortgages to
	be discounted up to 80 percent of value. In August, Hoover set up
	national business and industrial committees to aid small business
	and to spur use of the new system. Addressing a conference of
	these committees on August 26, the President proclaimed the
	necessity of coordinating individual action with governmental
	activity to aid recovery, and &ldquo;to give you the opportunity to
	organize for action.&rdquo; </p>



	<p>The new Home Loan Bank System
	took a while to get started,
	opening formally on October 15, and not lending at all until
	December. At the beginning of 1933, total loans were only $838
	thousand outstanding, but by March all the district banks were
	operating, and the total reached almost $94 million by the end of
	the year.<sup><a href="#Note-11-37">37</a><sup></p>



	<center><h3>THE BANKRUPTCY LAW</h3></center>
	
	<p>Another part of the Hoover New
	Deal message of 1932 that
	finally bore fruit was amendment of the Federal bankruptcy law to
	weaken the property rights of creditors. If there is to be a bankruptcy
	law at all, with the debtor summarily freed from much of his
	self-incurred obligation (which in itself is highly dubious, unless
	creditor and debtor had contracted for such forgiveness beforehand),
	then certainly minimum justice to the creditor would permit him to take
	over the debtor&rsquo;s assets. But President Hoover
	thought even this excessive, and in his annual messages of 1932
	and 1933 urged amendments weakening the rights of the creditor.
	These important innovations were debated in Congress, and only
	approved for <i>individuals</i>on March 1, 1933, and
	signed by Hoover
	in one of his last acts as President. Congress did not approve similar
	changes for corporations until the advent of the Roosevelt
	New Deal. </p>



	<p>The amendments now permitted a
	majority of creditors, in
	amount and in number, to accept deals preferred by the insolvent
	debtor for extending the time for payment without parting with
	&ldquo;his&rdquo; assets. As a result, a minority of creditors
	who would want
	instant redemption of their own rightful property were now
	robbed of their proper claims. If there must be majority-rule voting
	among creditors at all (and this seems odd since the individual
	creditors had no say originally on how much credit was to be borrowed
	or from whom), then surely the only proper course is to go immediately
	into bankruptcy, with each creditor quickly obtaining his
	proper individual share of the debtor&rsquo;s assets. Otherwise,
	the
	minority creditor has been despoiled, and now owns virtually
	nothing. </p>
	
	
	<p>Debtor sentiment was typified by
	the Cleveland Trust Company&rsquo;s <i>Business Bulletin</i>,
	which called for a bill to &ldquo;prevent dissenting members from
	successfully opposing&rdquo; &ldquo;orderly
	reorganization&rdquo;
	of corporations. President Hoover&rsquo;s 1933 message called for
	the
	measure as &ldquo;a matter of the most vital importance.&rdquo;
	It was necessary, apparently, to crush &ldquo;the obstruction of
	minority creditors
	who oppose such settlements in the hope that fear of ruinous
	liquidation will induce the immediate settlement of their
	claims&rdquo;&mdash;
	apparently a vaguely traitorous position to hold.<sup><a href="#Note-11-38">38</a><sup>The
	bankruptcy
	changes were opposed vigorously by the nation&rsquo;s bankruptcy
	lawyers, who particularly attacked the creation of a large bureaucracy
	of bankruptcy administrators and examiners in the Department of
	Justice, as well as the unwarranted governmental interference in the
	relations of debtors and creditors.<sup><a href="#Note-11-39">39</a><sup></p>



	<center><h3>THE FIGHT AGAINST IMMIGRATION</h3></center>
	
	<p>Undaunted by his failure of the
	year before, Hoover again
	pressed for legal suspension of immigration in the 1932 session,
	and the 90 percent reduction bill was introduced again. This time
	the reduction was to be permanent, not just temporary; the chief
	argument was economic. The A.F. of L., the American Legion, and
	various patriotic societies supported the bill, but Representative
	Dickstein (D., N.Y.) managed to bottle up the bill in the House
	Committee. On the other hand, bills by Dickstein to admit more
	relatives than the administration was allowing, underwent attack
	by the State Department, and no action was taken in Congress, one
	Dickstein bill passing the House but failing in the Senate. </p>
	
	
	
	<p>Thus, Hoover failed to get
	suspension of immigration into law,
	but he accomplished practically the same end by administrative
	fiat, and, in his fall campaign for reelection, he pointed with pride
	to his achievement, and prepared to continue his anti-immigration
	policy until the depression was over.<sup><a href="#Note-11-40">40</a><sup></p>
