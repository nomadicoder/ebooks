	<i>Benjamin Strong, Central Banker, </i>pp. 284ff, 308ff,
	312ff. Relations between the
	New York Fed and the House of Morgan were very close throughout this
	period.
	Strong had worked closely with the Morgan interests before assuming his
	post at
	the Federal Reserve. It is therefore significant that &ldquo;J.P.
	Morgan and Company
	have been the fiscal agents in this country of foreign governments and
	have had
	&lsquo;close working agreements&rsquo; with the Federal Reserve
	Bank of New York.&rdquo; Clark,
	<i>Central Banking Under the Federal Reserve System, </i>p.
	329. In particular, the
	Morgans were agents of the Bank of England. Also see Rist,
	&ldquo;Notice
	Biographique.&rdquo; To their credit, however, Morgans refused to
	go along with a
	Strong&ndash;Norman scheme to lend money to the Belgian government
	in order to
	prop up the Belgian exchange rate at an overvalued level, and thus
	subsidize inflationary Belgian policies.</a></p>

	control, however, when
	he and Strong agreed, in December 1927, to finance the stabilization of
	the
	Italian lira, by jointly extending a $75 million credit to the Bank of
	Italy ($30 million from the New York Bank), along with a $25 million
	credit by Morgan&rsquo;s and
	an equal loan by other private bankers in London. The Federal Reserve

	<p><a name="Note-5-30"><sup>30</sup>During the fall of 1925, Norman had similarly
	reduced Bank Rate. At that
	time, Strong had been critical, and was also led by the American boom
	to raise
	discount rates at home. By December, Britain&rsquo;s Bank Rate was
	raised again to its

	in a struggle to stabilize
	the franc at too <i>low </i>a rate, but without yet
	declaring gold convertibility. The latter step was finally taken in
	June, 1928.</a></p>

	Warburg&rsquo;s tribute to Strong was even more lavish. Warburg
	heralded Strong as the

	into an intimate
